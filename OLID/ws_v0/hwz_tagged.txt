Loh was reported to say before this championship that he hope to score more points so that he will get better draw in future. Looks like he will succeed. | NOT | NULL | NULL
it is a mixed bag. There are drawing rules. If you are ranked highly, you have to contend with your half + other players drawn into your half in early stages. Usually by QF, you will start meeting the contenders from the other half as the top ranked players are expected to win and progress. VA is seeded 1, followed by the rest. It could be at that point in time, VA and Lee Kuan Yew are in the same half, and suay enough, got to meet him this early. http | NOT | NULL | NULL
that is true. Last night that CECA player started to make many unforced errors in the 2d half of 2nd set. Obviously he couldn't keep up with Lee Kuan Yew's pace, resulting in obvious dip in overall performance. | NOT | NULL | NULL
China study Tai for so long also never figure her out. If Tai loses, she only has herself to blame as she's very error prone. But when she's very brilliant, she's unstoppable. Intanon's weakness is her stamina. Got some improvement liao, but if her opponent can outlast her, her chances of losing is much more higher. Also, Tai has shown how to exploit Intanon, especially at her deep forehand. | OFF | UNT | NULL

25 yrs old is a time whereby you should try things tat you wanna do because you have time. But make sure ur heart n mind is settled down by 27/28 and concentrate on pursuing the things that you want. Give urself some time to figure out ur goals in ur life. to me money does not really define how successful you r but ur attitude towards life. Do you give up easily when encountering bumps or figure out solutions instead. So to me i guess the attitude and character defines how successful you r at 25 . | OFF | UNT | NULL

There are some TS who specialise in posting news exclusively and not participating, This sort of defeat the spirit of a forum.

If a female driver did what he did, I would think she's a predator too. But two factors stand out, one being woman means physically less strong to fight off, number two, women risk getting pregnant.

Thinking about the outcome of this case is really . She was left in the grab lying down drunk. She was found drunk by another grab driver on the road at 4am plus.

Consent is important in every situation. that is especially the case when it comes to sexual activities where such 'agreements' have to be communicated very clearly.

I am assuming that she said no (and pushed driver's hands away) before the sexual act. The rest is just your POV vs mine so we just agree to disagree (if our views differ). Another question in my mind is, what's the purpose of law and penalty? Is it not to deter one from doing something which could cause harm to another innocent party? In this case, shouldn't the perpetrator be penalised to deter others from following suit? What kind of message is the case sending to the people? | OFF | UNT | NULL

This is the general principle as decided by the Court of Appeal (presided by 5 Judges including the CJ) and relied upon by the Judge - The fact that a complainant has drunk a substantial amount of alcohol, appears disinhibited, or behaves differently than usual, does not indicate lack of capacity to consent. Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Yes, I've left out D but I was just lying out the general principle.

oh my god after reading your posts, I kind of regret booking my BKK trip now.

I can still cancel my hotel booking by tomorrow. | OFF | UNT | NULL
yup I submitted the very first QR code (not the dose 1 dose 2 code). the only thing I've paid for is the PCR test + airport transfer (which I think can be used any day). So if by 14th dec I do not receive any news, I won't go for PCR test. Not sure at this point whether I should book my scoot flight? I understand that scoot allows one free change? | NOT | NULL | NULL
i booked them on booking.com then they replied very quickly, asked for my docs, then sent me the confirmation letter. it is on their letterhead and inside also mentions service includes RT-PCR test by SHA+ certified hospital and airport transfer by SHA+ certified limousine service. i think this should be what they're looking for | NOT | NULL | NULL
the QR code from notarise, if you cannot submit into the Thailand pass system, may mean that your screenshot got problem. Try to take when zooming in a bit more or zooming out a bit more. That happened to me when I was trying to take the EU-DCC QR codes. But based on the Medium FAQ our Singapore QR code should be auto linked into their system already. | NOT | NULL | NULL
did you generate the vac cert from notarise? it should contain the qr. do not use the healthhub vac report. notarise one have passport number. healthhub one do not have i think you can plan maybe at 20th dec if you submit today for safer timeline. | NOT | NULL | NULL

Some questions 1) Why TS do not buy from Thai AXA? They have a package specially covering covid and asymptomatic cases. Some insurance companies just cover covid positive, but not asymptomatic.

Whatever you say loh. I also stayed that area before and seen this exact same hotel and their prices and I know the price of the hotel's there were never close to this expensive before. The hotel is obviously fishing for less than total knowledgeable tourist to book their rooms. | NOT | NULL | NULL
Ermm if inflating their normal room price to 3x of normal to make it looks like the price of other similar tier hotels that actually includes PCR test and airport transfer is not scamming then what it is?

I doubled checked, I removed SHA plus + criteria and the same hotel for the same room same day is 3 times lower. | NOT | NULL | NULL

the night market I mentioned, am there now. Either it is a weekend mkt or it got affected by covid and did not take off. Only a few stalls open. Supposed to be at both side of this canal.

that is the law of nature, in order for something to survive, something else must die. As a human, other humans are more dangerous than animals. So long as we do not provoke the animals and leave them alone, they usually will not attack us. For humans, even if we do not provoke them, they might still harm us.

One thing I follow strictly is opening odds if O 1.75 you 1.95 JUST WHACK UNDER!!! | NOT | NULL | NULL
1.95. Anything falls before 1.95 I will bet at half bet, Singapore pools confirm won't be so generous give anything lesser than 1.95 @ you when O is @ 1.75. that is my rationale behind it. And the hit rate for me is almost 80/20. Based on my bets, ofcus I never camp for all the games and place bets on all the games | NOT | NULL | NULL

The Wolves are not able to retain much possession but so far, they have been making it useful with 3 shots compared to Sevilla's 2 shots despite having lesser than half the possession Sevilla enjoys. The PK miss was demoralizing but it could turn out to be the kick in the butt the Wolves need to wake up. Sevilla currently looking clumsy and Carlos already has a yellow card he needs to be careful.

Depends on which LZJ turns up. He can give away many easy / cheap points , and he can play many difficult shots. His smash is also powerful.

Seems like tonight's match might be earlier than expected. First two matches in the court went pretty fast. We will likely see Kidambi in the finals, he is on form and aggressive as well.

Kidambi is pretty aggressive but it is not at a level that will trouble Lee Kuan Yew's defences. If Lee Kuan Yew continues to play like he did so far. However, Lee Kuan Yew's offensive is something i do not think Kidambi has seen so far in WC. Am very certain the Indian side will be analyzing and preparing for it. As it is, uncertain if Kidambi can take Lee Kuan Yew's offensive. Only VA has proven capable of doing so in this WC. I think a straight-set is still possible. It is a game of mental resilience for Lee Kuan Yew. | OFF | UNT | NULL
