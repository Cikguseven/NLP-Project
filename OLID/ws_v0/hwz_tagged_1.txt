codependent is the opposite of independent ma. asian parents for eg see their kids as an extension of themselves instead of seeing them as individual with their own identity, thoughts, opinions, personality etc. so it becomes like what the kids do will be a reflection of what they are as parents, so as parents they will use beating, scolding, shaming when they feel the kids' actions reflect badly on them. parents in the past generations were mostly like that, now modern ones not so much la. | OFF | TIN | GRP

These are the managers that tend to load more work on productive employees and make them jaded. While other employees getting similar salaries do much less work, because they are slower. It makes people not want to work so hard overall, because there's no point.

sounds more like the girl took advantage of the taxi driver public nuisance while drunk cannot even make her way home. find some unker taxi driver that she know cannot resist him then sexually assault him. outrage of modesty by exposing herself to him by pulling her shorts and underwear down. I mean he wasn't even turned on so subconsciously he may even have been uncomfortable with it. on top of all that still lie and waste public taxpayer's money on her nonsense. really do not know why they do not charge her as a sexual predator instead | OFF | TIN | IND

I think you did not read the part where she willingly removed her safety shorts, panties, spread her legs, straddled him, grind him, then gave him a BJ, all corroborated by the audio recording.

I am thinking from the driver pov and I could see what he did. He is a rapist.

Kidambi is pretty aggressive but it is not at a level that will trouble Lee Kuan Yew's defences. If Lee Kuan Yew continues to play like he did so far.

This is the general principle as decided by the Court of Appeal (presided by 5 Judges including the CJ) and relied upon by the Judge - The fact that a complainant has drunk a substantial amount of alcohol, appears disinhibited, or behaves differently than usual, does not indicate lack of capacity to consent. Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done. | OFF | UNT | NULL

This is the law, one of the defences against such cases What is consent? - Sexual Assault Care Centre sacc.aware.org. Singapore To establish a defence of mistaken consent, the burden is on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he had in good faith believed that the complainant had consented to his having sexual intercourse with her.
