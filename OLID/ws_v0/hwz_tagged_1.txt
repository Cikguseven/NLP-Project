codependent is the opposite of independent ma. asian parents for eg see their kids as an extension of themselves instead of seeing them as individual with their own identity, thoughts, opinions, personality etc. so it becomes like what the kids do will be a reflection of what they are as parents, so as parents they will use beating, scolding, shaming when they feel the kids' actions reflect badly on them. parents in the past generations were mostly like that, now modern ones not so much la. | OFF | TIN | GRP

These are the managers that tend to load more work on productive employees and make them jaded. While other employees getting similar salaries do much less work, because they are slower. It makes people not want to work so hard overall, because there's no point.

sounds more like the girl took advantage of the taxi driver public nuisance while drunk cannot even make her way home. find some unker taxi driver that she know cannot resist him then sexually assault him. outrage of modesty by exposing herself to him by pulling her shorts and underwear down. I mean he wasn't even turned on so subconsciously he may even have been uncomfortable with it. on top of all that still lie and waste public taxpayer's money on her nonsense. really do not know why they do not charge her as a sexual predator instead | OFF | TIN | IND

I think you did not read the part where she willingly removed her safety shorts, panties, spread her legs, straddled him, grind him, then gave him a BJ, all corroborated by the audio recording.

I am thinking from the driver pov and I could see what he did. He is a rapist.

i give deadend response to counter deadend response. if she does not ask another question, I'd let it die a natural death. if she asks, I'd continue. but usually this kind i talk to would only ask when she feels the convo is dying. if i was keen to keep asking, she'd revert to only answering. such girl is must avoid. its draining to talk to such girls with no sincerity in wanting to know you. she ask for the sake of asking just to continue the convo. | OFF | TIN | IND

shoot them then end up they just unmatch its a waste of energy right? got another one she replied with only answer, i ghost her then a few days later she message again to continue convo. unmatched | OFF | TIN | IND

Life is that easy. were you poor before where yo have to survive on maggiee mee? On good times, I just buy rice and two veg from cai png stall where in Singapore, it is uncommon. have you suffer mockery and disrespect perpetually from different groups of people in your life?

Once you go thru my life, you wouldn't see life in the same way. it is a harsh world. | OFF | TIN | IND

Like everyone else, I have experienced my fair share of bitterness in life la. Just have to pick yourself up and move on. cannot dwell on the past and present while neglecting the future. Strangely, I like beer more at this age. When I was younger, I prefer cock tails. | OFF | TIN | IND

that is the law of nature, in order for something to survive, something else must die. As a human, other humans are more dangerous than animals. So long as we do not provoke the animals and leave them alone, they usually will not attack us. For humans, even if we do not provoke them, they might still harm us. I have first hand experience of this. Humans have many thoughts, emotions and desires, not so simple. We are even capable of destroying or decimating our species using nuclear weapons, which other creature on Earth can do that? | OFF | TIN | GRP

i do not know why so many people keep saying the ass kid is a great driver, i'll admit that his 1 lap pace is good, but his weakness is so obvious, 1 trick pony, can only use brute force to pass other cars. in my opinion a driver that is unable to size up his opponent when chasing and planning to execute a pass, in this case, over consuming his tyres, is not a good driver. once again, the skill of how much tyre to use when chasing and passing is learned by coming up through F3 and F2. | OFF | TIN | IND

The Wolves are not able to retain much possession but so far, they have been making it useful with 3 shots compared to Sevilla's 2 shots despite having lesser than half the possession Sevilla enjoys.

Maybe, my opinion is more inclined to China will not stand still by then 1) If by conventional warfare with NATO, Russia will be doom without help from China.

it is because of a lack of escalation in the face of a rogue nation that war world 2 happened. War world 3 will happen if nato do not act decisively to stop Russia. Putin had already shown a tendency to do land grabs eg Crimea, Georgia, when the world keeps quiet. He must be shown that his imperialistic ambitions does not have a place in this world. | OFF | TIN | IND

Nothing wrong with grabbing money as an athelete. But going around advertising such sporting victory is a disgrace. Loh and schooling serve national service.
