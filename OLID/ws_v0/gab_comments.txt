#GabStoryTime I dream about #Coffee 
#GabStoryTime with #GabFam - I once walked to the gas station near by to get a coffee. When I was leaving there was a group of black kids who approached me, asking if I could buy them cigarettes. I declined. They said that I was doing #WhitePeopleShit and would beat my ass. Smiled and walked away.

#GabTips click the hashtag. you might be surprised what you find.
#GabTips is there a mobile app yet?
#GabTips, if you search for "Gay Sandwich" to find funny gifs about gays and sandwiches, you probably will not get the results you were expecting. Best not to do it in public. #GabQueers #GabFam #Gab
#GabTravelTips   Always have bribing money if spending the night out in Thailand. The police will hound you if you look foreign. 
#GabTravelTips  Grimsby is grim
#GabTravelTips  If you're interested in visiting France, avoid Paris and try to visit other cities, such as Toulouse, Lyon, Bordeaux, Lille, Strasbourg or Montepellier. If interested in the countryside, Brittany is lovely, if you stay away from industrial zones.
#GabTravelTips  Tokyo Skytree, and Sunshine 60 have observatories you have to pay for. The Shinjuku Metropolitian building is the tallest building in Tokyo and has a viewing area for free. (Skytree is the 2nd tallest free standing structure in the world.) #Tokyo
#GabTravelTips  When you visit the bustling, cosmopolitan city of Hong Kong, be sure to visit beautiful Victoria Harbour.  While there, be careful not to open and run a book shop selling books exposing the secret lives of Mainland Chinese politicians. You will definitely get stabbed.
#GabTravelTips #Thailand(1): best time to visit - April (specifically during the holiday Songkran) it's polite for waiter/waitress to bow to you, it's impolite to bow back to the waiter/waitress (causes them embarrassment) smiling is part of the Thai greeting and Buddhism is central to their culture
#GabTravelTips #Thailand(2): Songkran (April 13-15): bring ziplock bags, you will get wet and you wouldn't want your phone/papers getting ruined.  bring waterguns, the bigger the better.  http://asia-backpackers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Songkran_8_-_Ayutthaya.jpg
#GabTravelTips - if you want a holiday in the UK:   #Londonistan is not suitable for children under 10  York is actually much nicer, cheaper & safer, to holiday than London  The food is getting better, and you could visit some stately homes and castles older than your country while you're here! 
#GabTravelTips - the keswick pencil museum is a must see @TH   http://www.pencilmuseum.co.uk/
#GabTravelTips AFRICA Do: Take lots of Mozzie repellent, sunscreen and condoms (for the ladies that like some #BigCocks) Don't: Drink the water, the local beer or swim in the rivers (lots of deadly creatures) And for those that think condoms not needed, careful the #SlowPuncture 
#GabTravelTips AUSTRIA  Alps: Speak some German? Good for you! But not here. Don't even try, it's pointless. Watch all the sunsets you can get. Don't be rude on the slopes.
#GabTravelTips Austria is a fucking beautiful country, the people are lovely and most speak pretty good English. If you've never been you should. As well as Vienna, take a trip to the vineyards up the Danube and get wrecked fam, their good wine is so good it's drunk before it makes it to export.
#GabTravelTips Avoid Kabukichou with your love interest... Avoid being lead away from your destination by touts, tell them to fuck off if you have too, sometimes you have to be demanding. Golden Gai is expensive as fuck, fun to look at. Don't leave anything unattended. #Tokyo 
#GabTravelTips BEIJING great city.   Be sure to sample the local cuisine.   Just don't forget to bring a gas mask in case the air pollution got the best of you. 
#GabTravelTips CANARY ISLANDS/SPAIN  Lanzarote: Vulcanoes! Black beaches! Surreal Manrique architecture. Visit Don Pillimpo's creepy doll garden in Teguise. Beware of the hippie cringe. La Graciosa: Stunning white beach.  
#GabTravelTips Chongqing,China  Eat Hot Pot (meats n veggies stewed in diff. kinds of peppers then dipped in sesame oil) - be sure to drink yogurt before and especially after if you are not used to spicy foods.   When winter, beware of "gou rou" - that is dog meat.
#GabTravelTips Don't go near the monkeys in Gibraltar, they're vicious little buggers. Stick to the Irish Quarter and drink lots of beer. #Protip don't walk up the rock, it's all uphill, take the cablecar.
#GabTravelTips Don't travel past Ulverston on the A590, if you get that far, it does have some reasonable festivals, but otherwise, turn around a look for signs to anywhere else in the world.
#GabTravelTips for Cuba  Go on a tour of the tobacco plantations and cigar factories, it's really interesting!  
#GabTravelTips for Cuba anyone?
#GabTravelTips FRANCE  L'Alsace: Visit the castles and recite inappropriate GoT-quotes, enjoy the wine and the krauty food.   Try French Creole cuisine as well!
#GabTravelTips FRANCE Awesome Street Cafes, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre...Beautiful City Remember to take your Burkini's 
#GabTravelTips GERMANY Drink lots of Beer, Pretty mountains, awesome architecture, Pretty Blonde Fräulein Be careful of #Rapefugees and #FuglyMotherMerkel
#GabTravelTips GERMANY I  Cologne: The cathedral is truly stunning but... well, YOU know.  Berlin: Take a Berlin underground tour. Endless historical sights but also endless cringe. CRINGE LIKE YOU NEVER CRINGED BEFORE.   Ask a German if he likes Berlin. If not, he's cool. Get him a beer.  
#GabTravelTips GERMANY II  Rhine valley: Stop whining, get wining. It's safe here.   The Autobahn has rules, seriously. Don't mention the war, the Germans will mention it by themselves. Don't deny the Holocaust, don't dress in Swastikas, it's punishable.  Just come and see before everything's gone. 
#GabTravelTips Go to Kamakura during the fall/spring, it's gorgeous. Also Karuizawa/Gunma in the Nagano Mountains has an awesome ski resort!
#GabTravelTips GREECE  EAT. JUST EAT AS IF YOU'RE STARVING!!!   Rhodes: My fellow crusaders, visit the medieval old town of the capital. If you are as lucky as me and get a small hotel full of knight stuff and catapults in yard, go full GoT on everyone.  Amazing temples, beautiful beaches, nice ppl.
#GabTravelTips HELL  Bring plenty of sunblock & be prepared for the best smoothies you'll ever taste in your afterlife!
#GabTravelTips If you're visiting the Lake District in England don't tuck your trousers into your socks, you will be immediately identified as an outsider, and as such, be subject to much ridicule in the pubs that night.
#GabTravelTips INDIA What a sight to see!! When arriving in Mumbai, look out of your airplane window towards the #WallofShame.....Bums in the air dropping a load on the tarmac! Don't worry about seeing India...As soon as they open the aircraft door you will smell India 😁 
#GabTravelTips ITALY  Naples: Visit the National Archaeological Museum (I like big marble butts and I cannot lie), Pompeii and Herculaneum. Enjoy the sunset near Capri. Rome: Do as the Romans. Show some decency for Christ's sake at Vatican City. HUGE pizzas. Go full Spartacus at the Colosseum.
#GabTravelTips Last train for the JR is at 12:45 AM, first train is at 5:00 AM. If you don't  think you can make it, go to an Izakaya, or just stay at your bar if it remains open. Internet Cafe's are an awesome option, 1,000 yen, stay for 6 hours with all you can drink soda/icecream/sleep
#GabTravelTips NETHERLANDS  Zeeland - if you're into quiet relaxing or family vacation. Amsterdam: Go there in spring enjoy the tulip madness. Get a bike. Don't waste your precious time in museum lines. Grab some Pannenkoeken and chill by the canals. 
#GabTravelTips Nishii Ikebukuro is a less hardcore redlight district, has an awesome Tokyo Darts Stadium where I'd spend time to time on Saturdays, no time limit and cheap 250 yen alcohol.
#GabTravelTips POLAND  If you plan to visit Kraków reserve some time to go to Wieliczka Salt Mine. It's not far and well worth it.
#GabTravelTips PORTUGAL  Algarve: Enjoy the stunningly beautiful beaches and get your cringy last bratwurst before America at Cape Saint Vincent.
#GabTravelTips THAILAND  Bangkok street food markets: Always buy food where the locals buy theirs.  Gulf of Thailand: Choose Koh Phangan instead of Samui and skip the full moon madness. 
#GabTravelTips THAILAND Careful what you wish for...that ain't no lady 😂  Always only spend "One Night in Bangkok" Never ever fall into the Chao Phraya...contact with the water is an instant killer
#GabTravelTips the last train for the subway is after 11:00 PM, be very careful with this. I had to walk from Roppongi Hills to Ikebukuro one time, 4 hour walk but fun as hell, did some convenience store hopping where you buy beer and keep walking, definitely let me explore places I had never been.
#GabTravelTips Tokyo's homeless people are mainly homeless due to mental disability, they'll leave you alone, just don't bother them.
#GabTravelTips UK #Londonistan  Take a Shoreditch street art tour and enjoy the cringe. There are free stand-up comedy shows on Mondays. Even more awesome cringe. Visit London Skygarden for an hour. It's free, great view. Mind the gap and the germs at the tube. 
#GabTravelTips You can go past Ulverston to get to the Wildlife park, but really, turn around at Ulverston.
#GabTravelTips Yoyogi Koen is an awesome place to take a date. Ueno Park has an awesome spring festival during the blooming of cherry blossoms, it also has an incredible history museum.

#PerfectMoment I watch the changing patterns of bare winter branches through the back window of a mid-fifties car. On my back, swaddled, I cannot move, but I can sense my mother in the front. I am content. At peace. I'm a little over a year old. This is my earliest memory.

#Trump is Bringing It Heavy Now. BREAKING: Trump Website CRASHES Due to HIGH VOLUME of Donors After Immigration Speech #MAGA #GabFam http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/breaking-trump-website-crashes-due-high-volume-donors-immigration-speech/
#Trump is here to do two things: #SpitHotFire, and #MAGA  And he has the energy for both!  #HighEnergy #TrumpInAZ
#Trump loaded the bases with his trip to Mexico and then hit it out of the park with his immigration speech in Arizona. Amazing. #MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://youtu.be/oaF_NwVbIgo
#Trump on fucking fire!!!!!
#trump rally playing "you can't always get what you want for the crowd."  Man...  That could be duplicitous.
#Trump slayed the meeting with the Mexican president and gave a speech initiating an imminent landslide, what a complete and utter shock to the mainstream media huh #LikeAFiddle
#Trump speaking on immigration soon   Watch here #MAGA #HillaryForPrison2016 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaF_NwVbIgo
#Trump speech in Phoenix, AZ just started.  MSDNC has it live because Maddow's show ratings are poor - like Hillary's health/wealth if she didn't feast off the tax-payers dole.
#TRUMP speech was amazing!!!
#Trump treats Mexico like the classmate you mocked but suddenly like because you find out he's got a car.
#Trump used to LOVE talking about the polls on twitter. Anyone know why he stopped?
#Trump We're gonna make this country great again.
#Trump's PR team needs to check itself w/ the Mexican Prez!   Like if all he has to say is "No" -- then you don't have a good strategy.  If you're hiring, T-dog, I'll sell my soul.   http://tinyurl.com/jkoswzu

#TrumpLive   Trump misspoke and said "amnity" instead of amnesty, what do you want to be the media brings this up?
#TrumpLive  "Illegals will have one path to legal status: To go home and apply through legal channels like everyone else."
#TrumpLive  "When politicians talk immigration reform, they usually mean amnesty, open borders, lower wages... should mean otherwise.."  
#TrumpLive  2 mins into Rudy's speech and we get a lock her up chant. Might be a new record.

#TrumpLive #Trump #MAGA   In terms of the second case the guy didn't even serve his 6 months of prison. He just disappeared  Also apprently he is White according to the BOP http://puu.sh/qVMHI.jpg
#TrumpLive #Trump #MAGA  In both cases it comes out of our pockets the cost of deporting them and in the second case to house them for 6 months for them to try again later. 
#TrumpLive #Trump #MAGA  This is what Trump is talking about when increasing the penalties for illegal immigration.   First case is illegal entry, a petty offense with no penalty  http://puu.sh/qVMnQ.png  The second is deported alien found in the US a felony that we pay for. http://puu.sh/qVMkb.png

#TrumpLive 36,000 watching on RSB, and 10.5K watching on Fox Phoenix.
#TrumpLive 3b. Deport all illegals in prisons. Any illegal arrested get to leave immediately.
#TrumpLive 3c or 4? Beef up border patrol
#TrumpLive 4 for real: end sanctuary cities
#TrumpLive 5. Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce existing laws.
#TrumpLive 59 mil immigrants since '60s, we now have a duty to protect America FOR THEM. Assimilation, integration, upward mobility.

#TrumpLive 8. We will complete the biometric entry exit visa tracking system
#TrumpLive 9. Turn off the jobs and benefits magnet
#TrumpLive a new Renaissance is descending upon the free world  #MAGA #HillaryForPrison #GabFam
#TrumpLive abuse of welfare priority for removal. #10 reform legal immigration to take care of US workers. #Trump doubling the fuck down. People worried about softening before shouldn't be now
#TrumpLive After we have deported everyone bad, built amazing wall, and goals reached. Then we may decide the status of those still in country. 
#TrumpLive America's Mayor
#TrumpLive any illegal alien caught committing a crime immediately expelled. No more sanctuary or nonenforcement
#TrumpLive Ask Congress on first day to pass Kate's Law. Repeat illegals get strong sentences then deportation. Davis Oliver Bill criminal aliens identities and swiftly removed. More ICE deportation offices and task force for catching dangerous criminal aliens
#TrumpLive Big Picture: I'm rich, not a politician, I love you and your family, we will do all of this and do it for peace and prosperity. Gangs suck
#TrumpLive biometric entry exit systems. Government required it, then fucked it up, as usual.

#TrumpLive Clinton's plan sucks. Clinton's judgment sucks. Clinton sucks. 
#TrumpLive Countries must accept their illegal immigrants back. If they don't, we'll airdrop them back home or something. Some retarded Supreme Court ruling means that if a country will not take someone back, they have to just release them, even if they were murderers. WTF?
#TrumpLive crowd goes nuts thanking them.
#TrumpLive Day one, first hour in office, criminal aliens out out out
#TrumpLive Did not know State was by law supposed to suspend visas for countries that will not take back criminals...

#TrumpLive it's hard watching these moms....
#TrumpLive it's obvious globalism has failed for every group that's tried. Nazi Germany, the EU, the Obama Administration... Communism may have proven itself a pretty shitty political system, but a global government hasn't fared much better. In fact, very few have even gotten off the starting block.

@a  If you are looking for more capital specifically to buy image compression power, hit me up, currently users are posting links to their memes on other platforms. NOT ideal. Conversely, a parasite model that weakens the host might be BRILLIANT.

@a  Thank you! You're not so shabby yourself. XD
@a  Yeah for real.   People need to be realistic, not everything can be instant. Things take time to develop.   @Gab is great right now but it's gonna be even better in the coming weeks. It's going to be crazy. But people need to be patient here. 
@a "...the long-time haven of weirdos, perverts and miscreants the Internet over..." makes me think of 4chan tbh.
@a "if you can't say something nice  Don't say anything at all".  Wouldn't it be more effective to deafen easily offended people? 
@a "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all" doesn't mean "if you don't have anything nice to say, you're not allowed to say it."

@a @curlytoot I have a few people around here somewhere... anything particular?
@a @e @support   How does @cernovich get his account? He tried to logon but username already taken (I told him it is reserved).  What shall I advise him to do (I will DM him)
@a @e @support what does the hazard icon next to the repost button do? Accidentally pressed it?
@a @e Lower priority: • Tooltips on Report/Delete & other places.  Love so far: • "View As" • Downrank button. Might be useful to have %upvote/%downvote visible on hover (any visitor to The_Donald will know what I'm referring to)
@a @e Needs: • Field/Button on every page to start a new Gab. Needed to click back to my own page to start this.  Desires: • Word/hashtag filter ('Don't show me any Gabs w/ this'); might be better done client-side on mobile app? • Gabs editable for 10 mins after send? (Marked as 'Edited'?)

@a @support "We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and **without notice** to you." (Emphasis mine) - Isn't this one of the things we rightly lambast Twitter for doing?
@a @support @emily the muting is all well and good but there needs to also be a block feature
@a ^This 
@a A clear category of a profile being SFW or NSFW?
@a A new button to push? 
@a also congrats!
@a Also when will gab allow advertisers/advertising on the platform? You have to make money somehow. 
@a and @emily were a match made on Tinder. @Futhington likes to cook or maybe just stare at recipes. @zhanx was underwhelmed at burger king. @ctomp513 knows women are more than just pretty faces. @furrrealz loves her corgis maybe more than #trump. @legendstatus knows first impressions are important

@a awesome! I keep sending these to you cause I'm assuming that's part of beta: report the issues. Sorry if I've been a PITA :)
@a Awwwww thanks
@a be careful what you're doing and always have someone to take over if something happens to you. Everyone is trying to censor the truth. This is a huge censorship movement and it's not without reason. Realize what you're getting into and take care. They'll come for you, hero. #ClintonBodyCount
@a better now, a party for all of us is a lot more expensive 2-3 months from now.

@a but we want it now!
@a but will it have dating?
@a By the way if there are ever any sort of internship opportunities, I am a silicon valley college student.
@a Can i... can i... can I have sex with it?
@a can posts from other users free to be used by others in an app or site? For example, a web app for some stats that relies on users' gabs and may need to save posts of others. Is that allowed?
@A Can we get a zoey to answer questions at a temple of Kek as a sensei of GAB

@a I can imagine a large number of developers like me want to get involved in helping build this out or extend it. Look forward to helping in any way possible. Let us know when the door opens. 
@a I forgot you were getting tagged in #theband. Hahahahaha 
@a I get it, but just BLAST it out and then ask one of us to repost! Maybe YOUR posts should have a diff font ( when u want), so they stand out on a scroll. Oh Oh. See suggestion. But NOT saying HEY #TurboTorba, get jumpin.   We bow to your #Magnificentness Your #Torbacity. 
@a I guess it depends what your interpretation of "notification" is - just show up one day and without explanation your account is gone is what I'm envisioning (kind of like how Twitter do). I would think that at least a "your account was terminated for X" -should- be provided.
@a I honestly love #Gab already. The simplicity and non-censor thus far is actually a breath of fresh air. Very nice bro. 💚
@a I knew this was going to be something before I was even able to sign up for the invite. Great work.
@a I need yellow smiley. :(
@a I only use a couple of subs as most of them are very one-sided and heavily moderated. Thanks for creating #Gab!
@a I really hope #Gab won't be going to these sorts of algorithms, and given what I've experienced here so far, I don't think we will. I'd rather see everything, offensive and otherwise.
@a I second that! Best ladies ever!
@a I truly hope gab takes off in a big way. The way YouTube have started attacking dissenting views is a real sight to behold. I genuinely wish you every success with this.
@a I was really confused about that story until I looked into it.  From what I've gathered, it was fraudulent clickbait that lead to a completely unrelated story.  PewDiePie got suspended (and I believe unverified) for absolutely nothing.
@a I would love to help/ get involved. obviously in the future as you guys are just starting out.
@a I'll drink my fuze tea and watch you make good on this promise.
@a I'm the king of typos...lol
@a I'm with him. One user the other day moped that Gab.ai was not yet beating Twitter in the user count. Hasn't Twitter been around years? He replied Gab never would, either. He had no real reason. Of course Gab.ai doesn't have to beat Twitter in numbers to be a big and viable competitor.

@a Impressive. What are you using for clustered message processing?

@a it tells me someone liked my post when in fact, they disliked it. What sort of sick game is this. 
@a It would be glorious to take out Google/YouTube . ;) 
@a It would be nice if the root word would block all variants: "jog" would block jogger, jogging, jogged, etc. Would that be possible?  #SupportLog
@a It's almost like you're creating what the web should have become...
@a It's terrible!  America is based on the right to #FreeSpeech .  Now Progressives want to squash speech for fear of their evil ways being discovered through debate.
@a ITS A TRAP!
@a Just a quick, intermediate, #Thanks for all you & the team have done on #Gab so far. #Beta is remarkably stable. May I add one item to #GabChangeList ? Graphic display area in #Gabs of 600px by 600px would be much appreciated, if technically possible. Look forward to direct pic uploads. #NoRush
@a Just how there is a "Who To Follow" I think there should be something that displays active new members. As #Gab gets bigger it may be easy for new members to be ignored. On Twitter it feels like you join a sea of people and practically need luck or virality to be noticed.
@a Just out of interest, is there a wishlist of features you're tracking or working to?  It goes without saying you're still on core functionality now, but might be useful to have (could seek user ratings of desire for them).
@a Kassy didnt make the list? This is an outrage!

@a One stop shopping. Hmmmm. But then one stop for Big Bro too...but trust you'll be thinking on that  Who's impatient. So far it's a fucking miracle. Feedback and impatience are two diff things. Without fb, u can't know where what to tweak. But no one's expecting instant - don't feel stressed.
@a One thing you gotta do if you can is enable an editing feature for up to, say, 10 minutes after a gab. #ideas #stuff
@a Parrots can speak and gorillas can be taught sign language, but never progress beyond a child's understanding.
@a Perfect; I'll take a look.  I was the guy contacting you on Reddit about the MX records; I got on using work address for now. Problem still exists on my end, but no need for more help at the moment.

@a so when will the video platform of gab come out? #SpeakFreely  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bePsGivjZpg
@a sooo.  Does this mean you are not going to be answering my questions for the next hour or so?!?
@a sounds good fam but where is android app? :3
@a Sounds interesting. I mean, you know that no matter what you do, your monetization plan is automatically better than TWTR's! 😂 
@a Stickers first...  AND A "DONATE BUTTON!!!!"
@a STICKERS ZOMG!!!! For what it's worth, thanks for doing this. Had the same idea for it (only I called it "Quip") but lack anything approaching technical coding ability. Good on you and your team, sir.
@a sure only a 3 day trip for me out there, have one on me mate. Enjoy it ther
@a Thank you! Been trying to get the answer to that question.
@a thanks for all you have done thus far!
@a thanks for replying.:)
@a Thanks for the update. This platform is awesome; the extended character count is fantastic for live-gabbing events. Well done.
@a Thanks for what you are doing man. I can't wait. I there a way regular folks can help? #GabFam 
@a That all sounds great, and so far so AWESOME, but I have a suggestion change the page so we can see everything going on at once kinda like tweetdeck, I think it would be way more user friendly, just saying.
@a That can only mean one thing.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGXzlRoNtHU
@a That's a pretty interesting idea. So kindof like Twitch?
@a That's exactly what's been happening to me lol /r/the_donald was the haven, now it's Gab!
@a The fact that there is anyone that can't see the regressive left is trying to obtain complete control is beyond me. Instead of telling people to be strong and believe in their self-worth, they teach them to whine about trigger words or perceived subtle aggression.
@a The future is bright! 
@a the rationale here being that I know you guys are starting off with a very strong foundation in "no, you can do what you want here," but a lot of other popular sites did too. It would be nice for the users to have tools to hold admins accountable to a standard of transparency in decision-making.
@a The ultimate shout out!!! 💕💕💕
@a They can have #EllenPao back any day they want...  She is the OG of #SJW.  BTW.... -NEVER- hire her.... for ANYTHING!!!  A hand grenade with out a pin. 
@a They hate us cause they anus
@a This article is goddawful for the record. From the same author who wrote one entitled "This is the final word on gamergate - and it came from Law & Order: SVU".  Remember that? Dick Wolf's masterpiece?
@a This is rigodamndiculous
@a this is very exciting. 
@a This new layer of censorship is apparently designed to work specifically on users inside the US, indicating that Dorsey would rather meddle in the presidential election by falsifying #Trump's reputation than rescuing what's left of #Twitter's reputation. When will Trump's account get deactivated?
@a Thoughts on adding polling to #Gab?
@a Torba The Great!
@a Trolling? WTH is that?  The only trolling I've ever done is on a lake for fish. Kids. smh
@a Twitter started teh censorship policy as early as 4/2015 that I have found.  Jack Dorsey literally lied to investors and the nation when he went on with Matt Lauer and denied censoring.  Straight up liar.  He's intentionally destroying capital.
@a Um, is this you announcing you got married?
@a Ummm...I identify as a trans-race otherkin, otterkin, bigender, aromantic goober.  My pronouns are nerd/nerdy/nerdest. RESPECT MY PRONOUNS! 😃 
@a ummmmm .... #Wow no #HeadsUp #NotNice #YoureGrounded 
@a Unbelievable. 
@a Very cool! Any info you can give yet regarding ads in videos from our glorious media overlords? User Channels similar to YT? 
@a very good thanks
@a we are drinking from the hydrant baby. 
@a we are extremely grateful for all you have done. The future is looking good with some #GAB in it.
@a WE LOVE ALL OUR WOMEN! <3 @Donna  @shorty  @rose  @amy  @furrrealz  @emily  @michellejoz  @themotherface  @ShannonMontague  @pollySPIN  @realMoxi  @Orose  @radaluvvy  @Spanishbride  @TOASTQUEEN  @Michellejoz  @Lirakitty  @ann  @elena
@a Well done, you two! Your kids will be amazing! If not, both of you still look amazing!
@a Well you do have quite a bit of help. The recent behavior of Youtube and Twitter is the best form of marketing for Gab that I can think of. The day I'm waiting for is the day that there is no more outrage over their antics. Just complete silence. That day is coming, believe.
@a Well, gab.ai has an MX record, but emails are going out with address at mg.gab.ai and that's got no MX record. I'd attempted to whitelist it on my server, but apparently to no avail. I'd rate it as low priority, but if others also aren't getting invites for same reason, then might need attention.
@a what about an Android app 
@a What's the ETA on live streaming? Day 25? XD
@a WHAT? No #GabCoin cryptocurrency on the product roadmap?!? Slackers
@a WHAT?! You don't have it now?!  THAT'S IT I AM GOING BACK TO TWITTER AND YOUTUBE!!!!!111!!!!ONE!!!!!11!!
@a where do you find the time?
@a Whoa shit!  Gab is gonna be amazing!!!
@a will gab support brave.com-esque bitcoin micro-donations?
@a will there be an android app in the near future?
@a Will there be an app too? 
@a Wine and fresh horses for your men, O Torba Of Gab!
@a Works beautifully!
@a Wow! I'd like to hear from @Amy Did she think this was real?
@a Wow! It will be like the No Man's Sky of social media platforms! >:D
@a Yea but can we stream video games like twitch?
@a Yeah, sadly even Google isn't immune to the social justice policing.  People ask me why I am frustrated with feminism so much and I can just point to things like this.  It is really just sad.  #SpeekFreely
@a yeap so did mine. Wasn't really intending on that happening until after the election 
@a Yes!! Can't wait!!
@a Yes, my liege.
@a You are incredible!  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of Gab.  
@a You are missing out on the best one! @gingy 
@a You can add @CarlCuck to that list too. Cause Tonight I identify as a woman. That's how it is in 2016. sadly I wish I was joking. #OhCarl #GenderGaseous
@a You forgot @WhiteMale :(
@a you guys are amazing. I can't believe what YouTube are doing, I thought that they were better than Twatter and Facepalm.
@a you just fucked my notifications into overdrive, but thank you.
@a you know what the cure for that is?  A cup of cement.  So you can harden the fuck up  https://youtu.be/1EY7lYRneHc
@a you should really really really make that clear!
@a You sir, are a miracle worker.
@a You would post that Rutgers stupidity (micro aggression) just as I was signing off! How dumb, idiotic and snowflakey are they?   #MicroAggressionsAreMe
@a You're going to need to distract us with tendies because we're too damn excited about all this. 
@a your site is for pedophiles
@a 👏👏👏👏👏
@a 😍😍😍
@a, my friend who is really really well known on Twitter applied to GAB but is like 20,000 on the list. His main is currently suspended, but he's right up there with Cernovich as far as being big with the alt-right. Any chance we can move him up? And if so, can I tell him the good news? :)
@ab A big ole jiggly butt.
@ABOB Funny how RealClearPolitics hasn't included this in the average. 
@Ace_Uncensored  #IntroduceYourself I'm a 26 yo fucking white male who jumped on the Trump Train as soon as he announced (cause fuck Clinton and no more Bush please! member of the silent majority, covert uncucker and thought criminal,  I'm not familiar with how tomake memes butwilling to learn!#GAB 
@Ace_Uncensored  My #FreedomBoner just got 10... -never mind, mustn't overshare 
@Ace_Uncensored #TimKKKaine
@Ace_Uncensored ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL. #Gab IS HIGH ENERGY
@Ace_Uncensored actually Mechanix was a Metallica song first. Dave wrote the lyrics and kept it when he was booted out. Metallica wrote new lyrics and four horsemen was born. No life til leather demo has the Mechanix on it.
@Ace_Uncensored Gfs favorite is code monkey! haha yeah you watch Braindead? he writes the recap into the intro song, HILARIOUS
@Ace_Uncensored I love it! But I really liked Death Magnetic so maybe I don't count
@Ace_Uncensored I would reword what I said based on that as I agree. I supplied more background but your statement is correct. Both awesome bands, big fan of them.
@Ace_Uncensored I'm dead, I may be delirious, but "YOU'RE AN ALL WHITE MEAT TENDIE!" got me.... I lol'd myself
@Ace_Uncensored it's as simple as that really, I went from 245 to 185 with a proper diet and moderate exercise.  
@Ace_Uncensored must say...never liked them.....more of a He-man, Thundercats girl
@Ace_Uncensored Or. Or, Or, it is something they discussed, like "ignore my tweets about Mexico paying for the wall, its all for the pleebs"
@Ace_Uncensored Rare footage of the hacker known as 4chan here.
@Ace_Uncensored remember, if the chicken is breaded you won't get shredded, if the chicken is plain protein and gains. 
@Ace_Uncensored Show us your body.
@Ace_Uncensored Stop posting shit I wanna read with funny references to tendies... A bitch is trying to get off gab and go to sleep.. #GabFam #IHaveTheBestGabFam #BitchNeedsSleep #TheBand #GIFARMY #OhCarl
@Ace_Uncensored Thanks!! Still trying to get the hang of it.
@Ace_Uncensored that looks fuckin cool.
@Ace_Uncensored that seriously made my day.  Thank you.  Back in character  Er am spy
@Ace_Uncensored those like already are fruits and veggies because like chickens eat fruits and veggies so..technically you are what you eat, right?
@Ace_Uncensored Well jokes on you because I'd rather be a clown in your life than out of it. 💋💋💋💋😂 awwwwwweeeee. 
@Ace_Uncensored You meeting clowns off of craigslist again? 
@Ace_Uncensored 😍😍😍😍
@Adjam just checked...I am not one of them...phew!!
@AdmHnsn it's a unicode exploit some are using, we are working on patching it. 
@Adrian Welcome to Gab 
@Aerock P.E.I. is where the codger in the icon is buried. He would not have liked True Dough. Either of them.
@AghoraShiva First stab at it... not that great, but something.  https://sli.mg/7UQ0OM
@AghoraShiva if you chew on a electric cable it releases a small charge that attaches to the toxic fat partcials released by sugar in fruit, thus preventing such aliments as common sence. as recommended by Dr itts a conn.  from the expensive faddontwork foundation trust me im a doctor  
@AghoraShiva it's not something to be ashamed off. #FuckCommunism
@AghoraShiva No worries, fam. I am not an artist, I can just bang around Photoshop a little bit. I will keep jacking with it and can hopefully come up with something better at some point!
@AghoraShiva urgh dont waste your money on ketone balls  Real food is good food
@agustus #awesome
@agustus *crosses fingers*
@agustus , on the 12th day of Tendie my true love gave to me...more Tendies!  🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔  #Trump #TrumpLive #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/WDqSjQ
@agustus @caro I had to look to this up, I had to, could this really have happened? It's not that I don't believe anyone here, THAT'S why I'm here, but holy shit, that's exactly what they did. I literally have no words.  #CrookedMedia #FuckCNN
@agustus Agree-evil propaganda
@agustus Bet if that shit said #blacklivematter they would erect a fucking statue.
@agustus coppercab is definitely trolling, and doing a pretty good job at it. 
@agustus Could they have found anyone MORE liberal?  Ugh ...
@agustus donald trump is a pedophile
@agustus Dude looks Hispanic as well. That would really upset the narrative. 
@agustus exactly, and I'll say as much later when I eventually respond to him, not that it'll matter to him but it matters to others who read through the post... I like to make him wait for a response, he literally sits at his keyboard just waiting to defend HRC and attack #Trump 
@agustus Grandma might start tweaking if she gives a presser. 
@agustus high five!-borat
@agustus https://i.sli.mg/fCfPRM.gif 
@agustus https://i.sli.mg/Sl5qAS.jpg
@agustus I can not wait for the day our main stream media finally die out.
@agustus I dunno... Wouldn't totally surprise me, but after all the talk there's already been you'd think they'd know better. But then again they never do seem to know better. 
@agustus I think it's more possible that she'd slip Bill a mickey and be able to play Jackie O at a State Funeral, and ...well considering, it just wouldn't be right for her to blah blah blah
@agustus I wish I could say I'm surprised, but I'm not. 
@agustus I would celebrate into the night if she did #NeverHillary
@agustus I would watch CNN if I had a button that would allow me to administer a small shock to the presenters at will. 
@agustus I'll go along with that explanation just as soon as McCaskill can tell us which public office Trump held during this ISIS formation.  I'll wait.
@agustus I'm from the UK. But i hope Trump becomes the next POTUS.
@agustus if #Cnn's thought was NOT making it a conversation about #Trump, they failed in the HUGEST way possible.  Yet more proof that real journalism is dead. Even journalism interns would know these things would happen, probably just scared they might be next on #Hillary's list.   
@agustus If that. 
@agustus Is CNN good for anything at all now?
@agustus it just shows their insecurity
@agustus Its gonna be ugly for real. Hes not fucking around. I won't be suprised if she tried to back out #TrumpLive
@agustus Just more validation to my decision of refusing to watch CNN.
@agustus LOL, good GOD this "ZOMG Russia" shit is RIDICULOUSSSSSSS!!!  biggest load of crap EVER. Only a WAR-HAWK like Hillary would want sour relations with Russia. FUCK THAT. #CrookedHillary #AwHellNo
@agustus Maybe but Trump will HAMMER her with that. It will make her look WEAK, and FEARFUL...neither are 'Presidential' qualities/images one wants to present at that point.   
@agustus me too, I really want all these foods right now. Ahhhh!
@agustus Me! Me! Me!
@agustus Ok. next question: Does it work?
@agustus repent for your sins with @jesus :)
@agustus she will need some rest....  No more #huma time until after the debates 
@agustus sit on a couch with a pillow #HillarysPillows
@agustus that is fucking bananas.
@agustus They are called the Communist News Network for a reason ya know.
@agustus this amuses me too much
@agustus This is EXACTLY why #Gab was invented.
@agustus This is fucking disgusting. 
@agustus Trump shirt doesn't play into the media painting Donald as a puppy punter. All while Hillary feeds off the souls of poor/disadvantaged orphans.
@agustus We know damn well had someone been wearing an I'm w/H shirt they would not have blurred it out and likely would have had some friendly anti-Trump banter.
@agustus Why is it posts like this the only confirmation I get is an imgur image.
@agustus yes definitely socialist media. It's utter insanity for them to abdicate their duty to report not indoctrinate.
@agustus 😳 #WhatAnEnding 
@Alec What did they do?
@Alex It does warm the cockles of your heart, doesn't it? 😃
@alexander #SchoolOfGab literally
@alexander @nick So how underground are you wanting to go? Will there be tendies for the sneak?
@alexander already emailed you guys 
@alexander I sent an email! :D
@alexander What are you doing for the marketing campaign! I'm really excited!!!
@AlexLane #truth
@AlexLane Silly me  This whole time I thought it was about sex and violence. ***shrugs ***
@AlexLane Yes it is! Loving Gab so far. And the #GabFam has been really awesome. 
@AlexPitti @a @porn Even though it's red and with an @, that's exactly what I saw at first!
@AlexPitti Thanks bby 
@algorhythm Wear like a badge of honor.
@algorhythm What happened over there?
@Alon Stop Phone  - Sent from my Capitalism
@ALX I pride myself in being open to any opinion (Such as holocaust deniers) I push myself harder to try and see it from their side, this isn't praise of me just a backdrop. I have not had the same quality of argument from Hillary supporters, that I've had from holocaust deniers  yeah. I'm waiting.
@ambie Anyone heard from Liechtenstein? Or are they just overrun?
@ambie countries in Eastern Europe, still majority Christian, will survive.
@ambie Once we put a man on the moon. Now we sue buddies in the locker room for mooning.
@ambie Poland, because they don't know it. #BadPolishJokes 
@ambie the Slavic nations are rapidly un-chucking themselves, and you can live on like $1000 per month. #GabFam
@American_Saxon @PPB has been slightly. Probably waiting until it's unavoidable. 
@American_Saxon Crime means there is a victim.  Someone who doesn't exist can't exist as a victim.  Murder has no victim.   #micdrop
@American_Saxon Direct Messages are a future prospect. We are currently looking at a way to make them more secure and can thus safely implement them
@American_Saxon Gov already foots the bill/tax payers so the 'no pay' is fine in that regard if we generate local revenue. As far as money to next of kin etc, I like it.
@American_Saxon if if if if if if if if
@American_Saxon just come back to me bb. I'll treat you right. You can have any color of the rainbow <3
@American_Saxon minimalist gov is required if you want to ruin your own life. I mean if you can see cocaine to a pregnant woman as a libertarian I figure you can use it yourself. And they fiend the NAP
@American_Saxon Mmm, not sure if he's worth that much trouble. I'll sell him cheap....one catch....got to take the kids too. ;)
@American_Saxon Night, have fun!
@American_Saxon No crime if no victim. Deads aint alive. errr
@American_Saxon Oi, that's my pimp! ;) 
@American_Saxon Sounds like a plan! 
@American_Saxon Sounds like libertarianism bruh
@American_Saxon They both work...Madame co-pimp...
@American_Saxon was my 900th follower. Hi, nice to meet you. How are you today? 
@American_Saxon We punish people for killing because it destroys society not cause there is a victim ya. I mean if I could walk up to someone I didn't like and blow em away social trust = all gone and commerce = gone.   Makes sense to punish, and death penalty is fine shrug but yup no victim
@American_Saxon Work em extremely hard, no pay. Prison environment is totally wack but not b/c of legit punishment but from gang/rape/$$$ buyoff.   Make Prison Bad Again legitimately. Work em into the ground. 
@American_Saxon yeah I followed you yesterday I think. welcome to gab! 
@Amy   Amen, sister!  #NoRestForTheWicked
@Amy  Haha  Yep  I can hear loud and clear 👍
@Amy  Haha You do you
@Amy  Yeah I was like where's #Mom? Lol
@Amy #DoesLoisEvenCarry? No, she's grown accustomed to always having a Man of Steel ready to do her dirty work
@Amy #FullAuto
@Amy #GirlsWithGuns are literally my favorite things in the world! Hell, one look at the banner on @caro and I was ready to ditch Lois Lane
@Amy #WomenOfGab list and you forgot @KassyDillon ?
@Amy *dropped* I can't spell today  OG
@Amy @e fixed already
@Amy @qq  https://media.giphy.com/media/11gC4odpiRKuha/giphy.gif  OG
@Amy @qq sorry for partying, mom. Things catch on fire when #TheBand gets together.  OG
@Amy @TH basically another downvote troll in pikari not using the @ 
@Amy @TH Maybe THAT'S why I was so tired today.
@Amy @VM LOL- FlashMob the two on a "quiet" vacation.
@Amy An you'll need a break again soon
@Amy and i know i am at least 10 years older than you :P
@Amy any ideas what the hazard icon is for?
@Amy aww thanks! ❤😂 
@Amy Awww, thank you #GabMom! *flattered* and also I love this #Gabfam! 
@Amy Better someone who can use them has them L-)
@Amy Don't feel sad, or I'll never ever be able to talk about some thing on here...
@Amy Fantastic, you're back! I hadn't even noticed!
@Amy Forgive my manners, how are you?
@Amy G'night Ma
@Amy Gabbers aren't shy, they'll let you know ;) but I think you're doing an incredible job as #GabMom and really undergirding this community. It's so incredible to be on #Gab from week 2.
@Amy grandson drop a toy down it.  OG
@Amy he would need to check the log on pikari to see what the downvotes added up to
@Amy Honestly I'm good, there are far more important things to do on Gab than worry about a few pixels.
@Amy Hot, hot and packing more HEAT!
@Amy how could anyone miss you you fat fuck
@Amy I can tell you this. If I don't get off of #Gab and get in there and get that toilet fixed, I won't be around much longer.   My wife will make sure of that.  OG
@Amy I can't, and wouldn't try to stop anyone praying, I get it all the time from my mother, she's a lay preacher for her parish so does all sorts of services.
@Amy I concurrently agree with no additional conditions.  The #GabFam is simply amazing and the power to #SpeakFreely has been underestimated for far too long.
@Amy I don't use them, so you can share them with friends and family.
@Amy I feel the same way about my son too!  ❤🐸
@Amy I followed someone, said hi etc, then my notifications went mad, said posts were being liked, but they weren't they were being disliked, so yeah, not good, but not going to kill me.
@Amy I got trolled out of a lot of frog points but otherwise I'm okay
@Amy I think she gets a lot from it, and I'm glad of that she has a hard time looking after my step dad now, so it's sometimes a welcome break for her.
@Amy I think we both know there's no controlling this #Madhouse. You've set off holding a tiger by the ears and hoping not to fall off
@Amy I was talking to @zhanx at the time so he's aware.
@Amy I'll let it slide this time... 😂 
@Amy is this true? Did @a get married?
@Amy it seems we have found a saboteur in our ranks with this Teridax fellow, have we not? Charming fellow. 
@Amy its all yours, I've got to play grown up for a little while.  #GabGrind is all yours.   Thanks, OG
@Amy just don't look too deep into this, some of us are on parole, would never identify who they are  >>>>> @@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar <<<<<< but #TheBand just likes to get together sometimes and jam on #Gab. Would love to have ya.  OG
@Amy lol we tend to argue gently about religion, often I think she agrees with my points about some of the people involved.
@Amy lol, he's just a good ol' boy that has a history. I would never share is his story, but since you twisted my arm, I will.   @DeltaWhiskeyTemplar has been convicted on 27 counts of loving too much, caring too much and having too much damn fun.  I would steer clear of him.  #TheBand  OG
@Amy luv ya, mom  #TheBand  OG
@Amy Mahhhhm you're embarrassing me in front of my friends.... *rolls eyes*
@Amy maybe is the difference in what we do? I started on computers in 90 so they are more natural to me than others. Also I if it helps without my beard i get carded for beer
@Amy more than just me involved in #TheBand, not sure if @Furrrealz would want the attention brought onto her family or even my family.  Gotta protect the #GabFam  OG
@Amy no
@Amy No I'm good, I'll earn them back and more :-)
@Amy Not the only one by far, Amy. Even with some bugs still to be worked out, this is by far the best on the internet now. Thanks to you all! 👍 #Gab #GabFam 
@Amy Of course!
@Amy Only one thing we can to with THESE kids..... https://k60.kn3.net/taringa/5/D/F/9/6/E/vagonettas/D7F.gif #GIFWAR 
@Amy Should we flag his post for you? ;)
@Amy thank @chris_story he helped verify it also. 
@Amy Thanks :-)
@Amy Thanks Mom!!! I will try not to disappoint you.
@Amy Thanks! Much appreciated 
@Amy They've taken the ultimate sacrifice for us. And for that, we honor/salute them!   https://i.sli.mg/8vN2zY.gif
@Amy We missed you Mama Torba!
@Amy We missed you!   #Behaved? Moi? Um... Well... Uh...
@Amy Well chill out now.
@Amy well the glitch was this. if you upvoted and then downvoted fast enough the user would only see the upvote notification and not know they got downvoted for the post.
@Amy Will do!
@Amy Yeah some people suck, I just try to not be one of them.
@Amy Yeah, everyone I know on here is cool so far! Even the crazy ones (like me)
@Amy yes, ma'am. We ahve work to do on the other place, shadow ban or not, the #Gab grind goes on.  #TheBand  OG
@Amy You can have any I find.
@Amy you could die and i wouldn't miss your fat ass
@Amy you could have a sack full if I had any, but I've been out for many years. :-(
@Amy you forgot my bae @rose
@Amy you missed our jam session earlier, mom. We blew it up, but did it safe. Law enforcement never got involved,   #TheBand  OG
@Amy 😊
@Amy 🙈 Aw! I'm so honored...
@Anarcho-Capitalist Hello fellow ancap! Did I beat you to this handle buddy?
@AnarchoElk Oh its picking up steam. Huge OG youtuber Philip DeFranco has been losing monetization on his videos because of the subject matter. Apparently youtube has updated their TOS and they can pretty remove monetization on any video they or advertisers don't like
@anime :)
@anime ;)
@anime can i have the baby
@anime downvoted 
@anime I have a Pom too! Cool :)
@anime I hope you have Zika 
@anime idk I have him muted, really annoying
@anime is fucking gay
@anime Kill urself
@anime me too
@anime Ponies, you say? Paging @king
@anime post pic
@anime shut up
@anime welcome to #GAB Rosy! 👋🇺🇸🐸   I LOVE your profile pic of the sweet puppy!! Is it a Pomeranian?!  @a made a great quick-start video on how to navigate #Gab! Also check out #GabTips! If you have any questions, ask any of your #GabFam! 🐸  http://youtu.be/sxlmq4jktDE
@anime you ain't having no baby by me unless I put it there
@Ann Awesome
@Ann Boooo! ;-)
@Ann Cool. I support this proposition! I'm even ready to finance it thanks to the Riothamus Foundation.
@Ann Exactly! What he did to that girl would be nothing compared to what I'd do to his sorry ass.
@Ann fine then, I will harass them as well, but since they're not here #DumbCunts 
@Ann I am wearing actual pants
@Ann I got a pile of camo cargo shorts 2 sizes too big for a buck a pair on clearance at walmart a year ago. It's about all I wear anymore ( plus random tank top) or yoga pants.
@Ann I understand EXACTLY what you say, Ann. The transition from an apparently dominant position on Twitter to a new network must be hard for those who value the number of their followers and status. My concern at moving to #Gab is the few dozen friends I have on T and persuading them to transfer!
@Ann I would ask for it's name but I'm about 9 books behind right now
@Ann I'd like to make it to the starts though, and before we meet the heat death of this planet ;-)
@Ann Nice job!!
@Ann oh Ann, you know you and Jo and Kari are really the only ones I care about anyway
@Ann only thing of Bill's she was riding 
@Ann Thanks Ann Make sure you are following Ann #GabFam
@Ann welcome 😁
@Ann yeah, but you get to not enjoy it a lot longer
@Ann Yes, that's just fantastic! :D
@Ann, is Jo or Kari on yet?
@Anns_Life   I have one to share with you - "Uncle Trouble's Drunken Risotto" (named by my nephew after I deglazed the pan with Jack Daniels) 😃 
@Anns_Life  About 2 ounces.  At first.  Then, I swigged some out of the bottle and dumped in some more and let the rice, speck and radicchio soak it up before adding chicken broth.  Its been a real crowd pleaser... lmao
@Anns_Life :-)
@Anns_Life @TheSibylSpeaks @lola_at_large #crawdad
@Anns_Life ahhh! That's not on! Chipmunks are cute!
@Anns_Life And in case you weren't sure, it doesn't mean someone is a fairy.
@Anns_Life D'oh!
@Anns_Life Damn 😰
@Anns_Life Flagging for what exactly?
@Anns_Life Good, I'd be happy getting pounced on ;-)
@Anns_Life Hahaha I agreed! Thanks for braking the rule and responding 😉
@Anns_Life hey, animals are animals! Gotta get them while they are still hot, right😉
@Anns_Life I know, but without data we shouldn't get access to anyway, we can't know any more
@Anns_Life I know, who would have thought you could trademark the name of a fruit...
@Anns_Life I search for "*" (just the asterisk) in the search bar. The posts are sorted by most recent. I just look at the names and see who might be new.
@Anns_Life It is? I've only ever watched one episode, some of it made me cringe.
@Anns_Life It's always me :-)
@Anns_Life It's normally used when something stupid has happened that could have been avoided with a little care. Your boss will say that the fuckup fairy must have visited, while glaring at the guilty party.
@Anns_Life no doubt. There's a bit of a learning curve. 
@Anns_Life Noooo! Little dipshits! Are they daft or what?
@Anns_Life not yet! keep your 👀 peeled
@Anns_Life Of course there isn't, I don't care, within reason, what gets people off.
@Anns_Life ohhh nooo that's going to be years, I'll be past it by then, Gab will still be going strong
@Anns_Life Probably lol, that's just the English for you With all our quaint ways 
@Anns_Life search in the box at the top with a "*" and it will show you the latest posts so you might pick up new people there, or search #IntroduceYourself
@Anns_Life So no chance of trademarking it then... :-(
@Anns_Life Thank you, I'll have to resize something and try it out. I'm use to sharing pictures on twitter from my blog but wasn't sure how to do that here.
@Anns_Life Thanks for following!  Just followed you as well! This place is fun so far, but I'm still exploring.  Can't figure out how to upload pics yet...
@Anns_Life There does seem to be a looser culture on granting them in the USA, thought the same can be said about patents as well.
@Anns_Life Well I have to be good at something. My talent is to be the fuck-up fairy!
@Anns_Life where's Hillary ???
@Anns_Life with cell phones in almost everyone's hands, we need to make a box to put them in so that they cant' spy on us. Something to block the mic/camera when not in use.
@Anns_Life Yesssssssssss
@Anns_Life You haven't heard the expression before?
@Anns_Life you'll be fine, just pounce on everyone and they will be happy
@Anonymous excuse me while I #SpeekFreely
@AntisocialJustice  Only a handful of people are seeing my tweets, I'm barely seeing theirs either. I know this because I spoke to others via DMs - either they're shadowbanning at mass or it's me and some others. I was wondering why my impressions/TL felt so empty. Either that or many have left.
@AntisocialJustice lord of the flies
@APG Can't argue with that.
@APG IT"S.THE.LAW.  (or does that only matter in regards to ACA?)
@APG Yup that too. Reason why asia is currently thriving. 
@ARoltner88 pranked
@Ash   >> Don't ever assume creatives will do things for free.  Amen, sister!
@Ash Honestly, this is happening to a ton of creators on YT right now.  It seems that if you criticize others, you might lost monetization.  I've seen multiple people comment on this.
@Ash I know plenty of artists, however, I don't think they'd be too privy to the idea of coming on here, some are content with the current social media sites they regular.
@Ash You mean the "chance to get your name out there" isn't sufficient? lol
@astralgenasari #AmExit
@astralgenasari bb all you need to do is pay the 10k fee + have the irs dig deeeeeep into your arsehole to find any iota of a cent you may owe, then stay in the U.S.  TADA! Alien. yw 
@astralgenasari Do you have a special flag I can put over my profile pic to show that I support Interstellar Alien Marriage? #SignallingMyStatus
@astralgenasari Perhaps something with tentacles?
@astralgenasari The #SJW generation. Reality will hit them someday!
@astralgenasari Uh... I was just asking... ummm.. for a friend. Yeah.
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare  How do you install Hillary in your washroom?
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare but what about those Gainz?
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare If that were true, I think we'd all look like marathon runners here at #Gab.
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare LOL!  Funniest Gab I've read all day.  Well done!
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare may you never lift weights again 
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare One mega burger with everything, 12pc tendies, a super sized french fry, two sundaes and a 44oz DIET soda plz
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare They should hang picutres of them up at gyms as motivation of what not to be.
@AsymmetricMemeWarfare We've got a lot of skinny bastards here then, hehe.
@Audrey duh didn't see the speeel checker is on here. 
@Audrey Not in the mood....letting this one go
@Audrey While that is odd I do trust who sent me this video 
@Austinholadia #RIPBantu He is another gorilla that died.
@Austinholadia How have you been liking Gab? 
@Austinholadia It really is so refreshing to be away from the cesspool that is Twitter and Facebook in terms of politics. 
@Austinholadia Your welcome :)
@avb #IntroduceYourself
@avb welcome mate, enjoy the # GabFam
@avb well done! #WelcomeToGab jump in anywhere and make yourself at home! 
@avi fuck Phil.. he supported the fucking Goofy ass Fine Bros
@avi i still don't like him.. never did
@avi True.. they censored a few of my vids of me recording my daughters dance practice because it had music in the background.. wtf YOUTUBE.. fuck your Gay algorithm #youtubeisgay
@B_  feeling better? 😷
@B_  great!! Rest, TLC and antihistamine! #ForTheWin 
@B_  it's literally the death of culture
@B_  me=mom first and Foremost. 😘
@B_  What will be heartbreaking is the slop that will be thrown at these people tomorrow. ;( #TrumpLive
@B_ e was working on a big update so it could handle large stuff or something in the future. Lol like my computer knowledge?! 
@B_ How was the CSPAN stream? Mine was delayed so I stuck with RSBN.
@B_ I know, I'm sorry. I try to be here for all of you. I'll check in more often.   #IPromise💕
@B_ It's honestly scary. Gab has to succeed. 
@B_ something like this?  https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1407/51/1407516611372.jpg
@B_ Yes, what you said is exactly how it worked out.
@Balls downvoted 
@Balls his whole gimmick is "I CALLED A TRANNY A MAN XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"

@Balls Youre having my baby?!!
@Bart @teridax
@Bart fuck yall nigas
@Bart me too but when I am really old and from too much energetic sex
@Bart yea kinda
@BasedJon How old is your sister? My son is 17. He is considered mild, but he still will never be able to live on his own.
@BasedJon I have been here since day one on #Gab and I am the token Jew, not you. LOL! I am the epitome of the stereotypical Jewish Mom too. Look out!  P.S. Call you mother.
@BasedJon I meant on the the P.S. to say: Call YOUR mother.  Ooops. typo!
@bb Thanks - I'm always running across abbreviations and the like that I don't know!
@bb What is OG? Racking my brain here...
@BenM I haven't heard about this at all? what's the story?
@big And we have a winner!
@big Nah I like them. 
@big Studying for a Bachelor degree in Computer Science, mostly focusing on Software Development and .Net technologies. You?
@big tarantulas 
@big We got a better arms-deal than Al-Qaeda
@BigJohn Dangit. You pulled the "identify" card. There's no topping that. 
@BigJohn hello!!!! its fun here
@BigJohn hey man where you been? We've been trending through raw and snack down! 😂
@BigJohn Or do you identify as a creature? 
@BigJohn You're just like an incredible floating creature. 
@Bixie thank god i replaced my hard drive with an ssd tho, I just shut the lid and peaced😅
@biz Could be interesting, depending on the time I have off of College might be something to look into. Definitely add me to the list of considerations! 😃 
@biz I am actually currently still a student, studying Computer Science and Game Development in College 😃 
@biz I'm not a developer of this site 😀 I am just intrigued by its structure, so I inspect the shit out of it, as to why I have posted about some of the lesser known features recently from some of the scripts I found. You have @e and the rest of the crew to thank for this beauty! #Gab #GabFam

@Blue I love you.
@Blue I thought this was going to be a poem at first...
@Blue I'm not too certain about the sane part but it does make me tolerable. ;)
@Blue no problem 😃 
@Blue Nope this is just in the code of the site, and the fields are empty atm meaning they don't have emojis assigned.
@Blue simple but true
@Blue That it does! Coffee is the second best thing ever created, music being the first.
@Blumiere  Smash Bros is one of the greatest things ever created by man.  
@BoogieBumper We'll know for sure if any bans start rolling out. Could you imagine something with the scale of the Reddit Revolts but on YouTube? Huge YouTubers refusing to upload new content and therefore denying YouTube further ad revenue. Would certainly be interesting.
@BoogieBumper You can also ask #GabFam and fellow #SEO gabbers for opinions. I'm sure you'll find someone eager to help. ;)
@BostonPaul He is fuggin killing it fam #TrumpLive

@brittany a fellow non american! we're a rare breed around here lol
@brittany haha well winter is officially over given its sept 1st now! our winters get quite chilly down south - prob nothing compared to what you're used to 🙃 
@brittany i concur with your scientific study
@brittany oh i aint a canadian, from the land down under i am 😃 
@Brittney  "Executive Agreement"?? --- noun an international agreement, usually regarding routine administrative matters not warranting a formal treaty, made by the executive branch of the US government without ratification by the Senate. --- This in no way can be applied to the TPP. #ObamaSucks.
@Brittney  From what I've heard, he has to save face with his own citizens.  Too bad he doesn't have big brass ones, but I guess Trump got the last pair of those...
@Brittney  Truth right there 👆 College searching this semester Don't know what questions to ask if a college is right for me. Meaning I want a college with people on both sides of the spectrum, left and right.  Btw Chem is absolutely terrible.  Barely passed it.  Thank God that other people get it.
@Brittney #FavoriteMovieOfAllTime   #GabMom 😘Ty 
@Brittney #Girl I like the way you think! #Cheers 🍻
@Brittney #popcorn!  This guy is looking more like a #Terrorist every day!  It is only a matter of time until he has a bruise on his forehead - not from the helmet, but from bowing to the east 5x / day!

@Brittney because Hillary is a congenital liar?
@Brittney best disinfectant is bleach  http://giphy.com/gifs/cJL1Y7MY1akc8
@Brittney But Chemistry is terrible :( At least inorganic. Organic is money.
@Brittney but you wouldn't get this gem!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoVLhUxhdSw  Matt Smith's acting was amazing when you think it was just him against a greenscreen/camera
@Brittney Fair enough, I loved BSG, especially the female cylons ;-) the glowing spine did it for me.
@Brittney For sure. That wasn't a dig on the state, just something I remember about the trip. I helped a guy at the hotel clean off his car so he could leave. As soon as we were done he said "f%*! this. I'm just going to get the room for another night". I laughed for 20 minutes on the way home :) 
@Brittney haha I agree! it was a great way to end! but they do deserve money and as one was a soap actor, i think they may not move on. And they deserve it, the acting was great, the writing is what slipped
@Brittney haha yeah great episodes! I'm going to tell you to watch preacher if you haven't. AMC has been win lately
@Brittney Having studied in STEM - this is true.  The "humanities" felt, like, waaaaay over there.
@Brittney he might be on #Gab but he didn't even bother posting the video here. It was his version of what he thinks we are all about. Some of it was true, but a lot was extremely cringeworthy tbh 
@Brittney here's what the sky looks like on an average summer afternoon over here  http://blog.fitzcarraldoeditions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/grey.jpg

@Brittney I 'was' pretty good with languages, I could get by in french and german spoken when I was in the army, it's been a long time though.
@Brittney I am sooooooooooooooooo glad you said that...
@Brittney I did reverse, and saw it was the same actor/actress they do well together. then realised they date irl. (also she was in Marvel Shield and a few new movies)
@Brittney I find different far more interesting than similarity, it's why I hate how so many women now try to look alike.
@Brittney I just rechecked the cast of Farscape, all the women are hot...
@Brittney I learned about 5 phrases 35 years ago in a little town called Dufftown of a rather sweet young lady, I've forgotten them now.
@Brittney I really do appreciate it, but I'm trying to work out what I can do with email settings and to see if things are still getting through, I just need a few minutes with nothing else happing to my email without shutting it off here.
@Brittney I remind myself that the snow shovel gathers moss here in Georgia.
@Brittney I saw it, I've seen a lot worse, tagging it to users is the wrong thing though
@Brittney I thought the whole point of #GAB was to have a place where alt-right / conservatives, etc. could actually talk about stuff, without the bullshit whining of the crazy lefties on Twatter? Too right for folks, Twatter is ----> thattaway ;) #SpeakFreely
@Brittney I watched very little SG1 it's not that I didn't like it, I just didn't have the time.
@Brittney I will always take second place to #MomsEverywhere. That's the way it should be, but I'm happy to be included in the #GoodMomList 💕 #GabFam 
@Brittney I wish that was a movie :( get ryan reynolds on it.
@Brittney I'll trade you a British summer for yours.
@Brittney I'm having a look now, but I like not knowing what the songs mean
@Brittney I'm pretty sure I saw a picture with the markings down her back at one point, yes that flicks switches in my head
@Brittney I'm still getting emails though I think, need to stop people liking or reposting my gabs
@Brittney If this isn't foreshadowing of her impending war with Russia idk what is. We cyber attack other countries all the time.
@Brittney if you're trying to turn me on, it's working
@Brittney imperialism was "bad "how and for who
@Brittney Is that the woman with the mottled patches?
@Brittney it seems to have stopped the number going down
@Brittney it's all good. It's still beta it will all balance out in time. 
@Brittney It's never too early! Every good hurricane party must be prepared for properly with a trip to the beer store before everyone else gets there and cleans it out! 
@Brittney Just about all alien species have hot women, especially in Farscape
@Brittney Just accidentally did it on your post.  You still here??? 😀 
@Brittney like???  https://media4.giphy.com/media/xT1XGXFohr27q0Afmg/giphy.gif
@Brittney lol, NC is a fun place to reside for sure. I spent a couple weeks in Durham and I had a blast. The day I left, it snowed 12" and I was the only person on the roads but the cops. Good times. 
@Brittney Makes sense. In the mean time we can only imagine what these sick people are doing with all those poor frogs.
@Brittney maybe, but its not to early to buy the alcohol
@Brittney Meant this one, forgive me, I've been drinking  https://i.sli.mg/RaygR5.jpg
@Brittney Name a left leaning person that is vocal... that doesn't like a leftist safe space like Twitter? I'm fine with discussing anti-religion (I'm agnostic at best) and with discussing BLM/WLM  race of any kind. My opinions will differ from others. we can argue. but no drama, they want drama
@Brittney not sure! Self destruct? Report? 
@Brittney Oh no, Seven of nine would be an equal, the cyborg things is erm... Very nice... lol
@Brittney oh the pressure. Is it tap tap tap or tap tap tap. Gah! 
@Brittney Oh yeah, HillDawg's track record as secretary of state is the gold standard of international relations  #MAGA
@Brittney should have replied to me with https://media1.giphy.com/media/jq9Zk7LyonSmc/200w.gif  From the sounds of it.
@Brittney Thanks.. *Flounce*  ;-)
@Brittney That's bad I fancy the pants off her...
@Brittney the first test was donating $1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation
@Brittney There's a reason StackExchange requires you to achieve a minimum amount of reputation before you're allowed to downvote. It's to stop cranks from creating hundreds of throwaway accounts just to downvote (and remove reputation from) people they don't like.
@Brittney to detract I still want you to agree that was Matt Smith's best acting as Dr. Who! :P
@Brittney To keep my love for the music as it is, I'm willing to stay ignorant. And that's saying something for me.
@Brittney TRIGGER WARNING: RICE CHART
@Brittney True. People know to be wary of my pointy sticks.
@Brittney We are whatever you say we are  #TheBand  OG
@Brittney woah, bitch! step off. Tennant is the best, but watch the clip. Smith earned his Dr. status there. and holds second best!   Also my favorite supernaturals other than their father episodes (superb) were Gabriel
@Brittney Working from home, I love those afternoon heat storms.   I like to open a window, sit back and sip some Southern Sweet Tea and #write until my evil little heart gives out.
@Brittney yes I like those, and yes I'm a bad man :-)

@bro  Question for production savvy Gabbers: is it possible to blur something on a live broadcast?
@bro #ParentingWin. My four year old says Yeeeaaaah. 
@bro gosh I miss that show!
@bro I got you bro 😁
@bro I guess Mr. Fishy guy didn't consider this before posting his conspiracy theory.
@bro that profile pic: the BEST. 
@bro The 'man saves baby' connection is relevant because it would present a Trump supporter in a positive light. If he was on CNN because he was arrested for MOLESTING a baby, you can bet they'd leave the Trump logo alone. And yes, it's a liberal media conspiracy when they do this shit constantly.

@Brohammer B-12! Take 2 before you go to bed.
@Brohammer do what I do, move a lot. states/countries. paltry info won't doxx you! :P I understand though! just curious
@Brohammer flip? I used to do a bit of demo/flip in Texas
@Brohammer get a glass of water with every alcoholic drink, switch to sugar free mixers, don't eat lots of salty or fatty food, switch to just water for a couple of hours before bed  #NutritionTips
@brohammer is loyal and well he lives in his mom's basement so there's that. @Don and @OG have no problem fucking your notifications into a flash flood of shit. @Brittney is so good she puts up with the guys in the great #GifArmy like the hot and funny @Roberto. 
@Brohammer it's not hard when your competition is "healthy at every size" SJW's 😮 😮 
@Brohammer OMG then it MUST be true I feel so validated ;)
@Brohammer Only drink as much as you can handle. Make sure you eat something to avoid a hangover. if you get a hangover, some Gatorade/Powerade will help sootheach the headache. 
@Brohammer seems legit, Mr. McDuck. 
@Brohammer unsweetened tea, iced if you prefer, lots of water, naps
@Brohammer we'll give you magnetic bands to focus your chi(not qi) and then we'll use UV radiation in a SPA with MINERALS and it will absorb TOXINs from your body!   just... make the check of 650$ out to LoLoLoL Enterprises. 
@bryanb coffee is addictive :<
@bryanb Yeah I know, I just don't like the principal of addiction.  Depending of substances seems like a weakness.
@Bsan ahh good old bro science  Occasionally half right on what to do, always wrong on why
@Bsan It does seem kind of strange that something so routine went so horribly wrong especially since I imagine they have so many things on a checklist to look for before they fire up an engine. Its not common they miss something that could cause such a catastrophic failure these days.
@Bsan load of bollocks, waste of money, placebo effect works well, eh?
@Bsan that article is reviewing evidence into health claims (ie there isn't any).  If you are on HFLC you already have a tonne of pseudoscience in your mind. Fucking ketosis and all that balls.  Just eat home cooked food from fresh ingredients. Lentils wont kill you  #NutritionTips
@BubbaVic Give it time my friend, give it time. If @a builds it, they will come.
@BubbaVic Hey, are you the Vic who does VNN every morning?
@BubbaVic Jo's being a butt about it, I want her to come though. Kari is waiting in queue. 
@BubbaVic Kari is waiting to get her email approval to be here, but Jo is kind of a hold out on Twitter for some reason. 
@BubbaVic OK. Thanks.
@BubbaVic yeah, the downside, for them, of memory holing every offense, is not being able to document why they are offended
@Buckby good luck with the modern day fight for liberty and freedom of speech. 
@BuncyTheFrog @a @support the rule isn't the problem, the use of the rule is the problem. Twitter should have the right to terminate whoever w/o notice its a private company. The problem is they claim to be a free speech platform and use that power to censor instead of ban actually harmful content.
@BuncyTheFrog I understand "without notice" to mean they don't have to warn you. "without explanation" sounds like what you're talking about but idk.
@BuncyTheFrog if you're continuously posting CP or anything else illegal, we would need the right to do this, no? 
@BuncyTheFrog Oh I'm sure..just hope it's used at discretion for those type posts & not abused
@BuncyTheFrog You'll want a rule like that for cases you don't have rules for. The bad guys don't play by the rules. They don't have to exercise it. At the end of the day its a business and they have to act like it. Twitter forgot that.

@C, 7th son of a 7th Tendie 😋  🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔  #Trump #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/lSfASR
@C_  I think they do. I think many are of low morals.  They know she's crooked & evil- they just think she'll be evil for what THEY want so they allow it.  Some are just bat shit insane. 
@C_  Thanks bruh. This is the second  plage of Egypt all over again
@C_ #CantTweetWithoutASeat  If Donald #Trump was at all qualified, he would have gone to Saudi Arabia. -H
@C_ #CantTweetWithoutASeat  Trump visiting Mexico and not tipping the #TacoBowl demonstrates just how racist he is. -H
@C_ 100% agree, it gets to me that people dont focus there anger on those who cause the problem, we shouldnt be findin a truth to fit the narrative, we need to be explaning the narrative that is the truth.
@C_ @CarlCuck Impossible. He's probably being cucked as we speak hence his absence. 
@C_ @m  #GabFam #Gab #GabCheevos #FreeMilo #SecondPostPeople  http://imgur.com/a/eBxus
@C_ @TH just doing what we can to help ;)
@C_ All they need do is play to people's emotions, rub their bellies and tell them how compassionate it is to welcome the world into your lands, then sit back and watch the magic happen.   By the time the audience figures out the trick, the rabbit is out of the hat and hopping off the stage. 
@C_ Also, I can tell you, as an Australian, I want a strong America to stand side by side with as we have done in many conflicts over many decades. The alternative doesn't fill me with much optimism. 
@C_ arnt there there already laws against racism anywere?
@C_ Been thinking on this for awhile. A Bi-Partisan nationalistic movement. Once upon a time, Left and Right was an argument between two sides of the same coin. Everyone put their country first, but just disagreed on things like labour relations and economics. Get the nationalist part right, then go
@C_ Brings us to a lovely #LiberalHypocrisy  I've enjoyed watching the commentariat weasel around playing the 'oppose at all costs game'.   For decades the world decried the USA for being "world police", the minute Trump says this should cease, he's decried for making the world "more dangerous". 
@C_ CNN has been on a constant decline via ratings. Which means they're losing a lot of money. They're trying to pull away from the Sink Ship USS Clinton to keep from having their jobs go to independant news groups. But they'll preach for your jobs to go elsewhere. #OhCarl #SavingBacon
@C_ considering it's the middle of the night for most Americans, I'd say they're still following their status quo. They just need plausible deniability to say they aren't inherently anti-Trump. 
@C_ Except, if the goal is to build a brand...you always have something to lose.  If I am to become dependant on financial support from a platform,  I need to trust that I'll be able to keep doing so.  @a, I'd love to see your thoughts.  Any steps in place to force your own company to stay open?
@C_ False idols on pedestals. They take their cultural cues from MTV and The Kardashians now. :D 
@C_ have a good night. Until next time #OhCarl #KeepOnTrumpin
@C_ https://i.sli.mg/6KUlNF.jpg I think the days of the Mass Media's thought grip is finally coming to an end. People had enough. I just hope people watch their officials and media outlets with a lot more scrutiny from here on out. Scrutiny is what they deserve. 
@C_ i get that but thats a politicians job, the police shouldnt be expected to be politicians, there there to police! and common sense says, you heavy presence were theres most crime, and  target types most associated with crime.
@C_ I imagine it's really stressful over at CNN. When money's lost. ShareHolders get pissed who then shit on the Ceo who shits on the executive team who shits on the lower management who shits on the anchors and editors who shits on the back crew who shits on the janitor. Think of the poor janitor
@C_ I understand, but as you said...this shouldn't be taken out on the users, especially when said users are the entire driving force of your platform.  It especially should not be done secretively, without pre-informing everyone.  People just got de-monetized without a warning on policy change.
@C_ I would have to slightly disagree. #BLM does in fact have leadership and even their own website. And judging from those two things, trash.
@C_ I'm not sold on the exporting of democracy. As far as I can tell, they don't want it. They laugh at our way of governance. If they want democratic freedoms they should bleed for them just like we did. I'm sick of seeing patriots die overseas for others to later be blamed for hell they embrace. 
@C_ indeed #WheresCarl @CarlCuck mostly like being cucked #TheresCarl but we can't stop until we know for sure.
@C_ Indeed. And Hillary shying away from legitimate pressers whilst the mainstream media run cover for her, well, every day it confirms Trumps narrative just that little bit more. Every day a few more people think "Gee, this show really is rigged".   She's shitting the bed big time. 
@C_ It got replaced by "When in Rome, demand the Romans accommodate you".   Cultural relativism. No culture is subjectively better than anyone else's, so the intellectual castration manifests into a free for all where the values which underpin society are deemed by whomever screams the loudest. 
@C_ it's a beautiful thing. As individuals none of us are capable of tearing down the constructed myopia thrust upon us over the last 40-50 years. But when one turns another, and they turn another, and so on, it's a snowball rolling down a hill now. They can't smother it. 
@C_ its as the saying goes, "even a broken clock is right twice a day".
@C_ Just doing my part to keep the night alive. It's nice chatting it up with people for a change. #OhCarl #NocturnalRecluse
@C_ lol mb. I was wondering since Andrew is married I think xD
@C_ nah I'll never get it. Thats why @twitter @Google @Facebook and @youtube are shadowbanned on a private twitter clone.   Remove what you're afraid of. Not so different than twitter now is it. 
@C_ Oh he's old white rich man. A nationalist, a patriot, non PC and unapologetic.   I imagine they just assume whatever he likes must be wrong, even if they themselves thought it was right yesterday.   
@C_ Oh reserved...right. Then how come then @twitch, or apple, amazon and all the politicians aren't "reserved". Did they not anticipate them joining as well? Seems like the only ones they're saving are the ones they're actively trying to compete with. That and pewdiepie. 
@C_ sayin they need reforming surly imply's that the police as a whole are racist?
@C_ Still tho ive already seen some gross stuff on this site. Some filter of nsfw tags would be nice.
@C_ Thank you very much. Utilizing the Gab features would be a great way to start it. I found the hardest part though is getting a cohost or two. Cause imagine picking a random topic that says  "Pedophilia is a-ok and shouldn't be punishable" Definitely gotta have steel nerves to support that one.
@C_ That's great, but cops still act like an occupying army towards the poors. Realistic information on dealing with the cops would take that into account.   Perhaps, the shame factor would push people to change. If not, at least we wouldn't be pretending about where we stand.
@C_ That's why I think this idea may be fly. Users submitted topics. Each Host draw a topic at random. Have some time to prepare for your topic and against the other host. Users vote on best debates and have some point system set up so you can have seasons. Winner is King Gab It's still a bit rusty 
@C_ The brand I'm talking about, is the content creator's brand.  Using YT as an example, many try to create a brand around themselves to make a living...if you cannot trust ANY social platform, the ability to do this is lost.
@C_ The current trend still creates one major issue, that I'm not sure how new platforms will solve effectively...how do users trust new services when they were told the same kind of things with the prior service.
@C_ The problem with the cops isn't racial as much as it is socioeconomic. I pass for white, and I've lived in good neighborhoods and bad. Trust me, you get treated entirely different when you're in middle class suburbia wearing a shirt and tie, than when you drive a beater car in the ghetto.
@C_ The truth of "multiculturalism" revealed. Destroy the unity of a nation by creating nations within nations who fight amongst themselves. 
@C_ They are still going down, no matter what positive shit they try to do now. Too little, too late, now that Alternative Media has arrived!
@C_ Top the TOP! #OhCarl #GabNation
@C_ Trying to win back some credibility or knock the collusion narrative on the head.   As we get closer to Nov 8 they will start to ramp up the shilling once again. 
@C_ We gotta think big even when this is developing. While @A and his crew bust their ass getting #Gab smooth and sleek. #GabFam gotta do their part as well when it comes to creating content. It's content that draws the crowd. I've had an idea for a debate competition which may work for Gab's style.
@C_ Well, #BLM is a bunch of hood rats and attention whores. I suspect that they'd have problems with the cops no matter what.  I have very little trust in the police but I know how to deal with them: pass for middle class or better, and don't make yourself a problem that they have to solve. 
@C_ Well, as long as people find reasons to be offended...;)
@C_ When I followed Pewdiepie on Twitter about an hour ago, he was "down" to 4.76 M followers. But now up to 6.69 (we've seen this before). Seriously. #FuckJack #FuckJackInTheHeart 
@C_ When the culture they come from is similar, assimilation takes care of itself largely.  If you're someone who has lived under an oppressive theocratic dictatorship, you aren't going to move to L.A and start walking around topless. You're going to live pretty much as you did, just without fear. 
@C_ Yup there's not too much depth to a regressive mind. But the mental gymnastics are amazing. #OhCarl
@caeruleusV  you're not a real beta fag until you got MGTOW
@caeruleusV Go for it. I've turned into a damn wordsmith due to over education and my philosophical outlook.
@caeruleusV That's the wrong tone unless you wanted super downtrodden.  "I've a patreon at 'xyz' if anyone is interested in helping towards a new PC & software. These will help me to make better videos. I've not set any reward tiers yet, but I'm looking through some ideas."

@CarlCuck STFU and do it
@CarlCuck They might spread them on toast for that #Marmite taste?

@Cary  google chrome is a very heavy load on RAM usage. How much ram is currently in your machine? This doesn't seem to be an issue for my computer.  https://i.sli.mg/ZsEUS4.png
@Cary a #PepeOrTwo ! #Lol
@Cary always send everything you can :)
@Cary and #Frogs 🐸
@Cary dating myself first job out of highschool (94) was helpdesk at a major corp. Moved to the server side and I got tired of not seeing the sun and got a skilled trade instead (not like computers in not a skilled trade also)
@Cary I can get you the list 😃 
@Cary I use gab on my galaxy tab 10.1 with chrome and it works fine. It is the desktop version doing this? if you so you can go to the settings and turn off the open links in new window
@Cary I will have @emily check into this. I have a lot of friends/family that need the 3xl size. #WeLoveElephants #NoPunIntended 💕 #MoreToLove 
@Cary oh and by "Find an emoji you like off that list" I meant find it on the pastebin list and add a ":" to it and you can paste away, or just memorize the name so you can search it in the built in listing system.
@Cary omg that is awesome! 
@Cary S&W 317 AirLite loaded with birdshot. Small snake, but inside my garden snake fencing, so that's a bit worrisome.
@Cary Thank you for your support! I've spent my whole life being afraid of saying the wrong thing or doing something that might offend someone. I'm done walking on eggshells. I will no longer apologize for being who I am. 
@Cary thank you sir! I do my best  #SpeakFreely
@Cary Thank you so much! Huge help. 
@Cary They are B&W on PC but on most mobiles you will see them normally :) Here is the post with the full list: https://gab.ai/tsukle/posts/127043
@Cary they do have "lightweight hoodies" and Tshirts in the 3xl sizes. You need to click the arrow next to "clothing styles" and you will be able to see different merchandise, the Tshirts are also available in 3xl. I hope this helps! #GabFam 
@Cary yep back then i was called kid and anything they didn't want to fix i was given the task. Till the layoffs started and i told my manager, not sure why you laid them off, i just gave HR my notice
@Cary Yep 😃 the list auto updates for you as you type in it. Find an emoji you like off that list and add a ":" to it and you are ready to roll!
@Cary You know, I don't really know...I'm not that knowledgeable. I'm a johnny-come-lately to guns.

@CattleDog It's probably a good thing that an obsequious RNC/GOP Establishment accommodating Hillary and politely not screaming about a softball non-debate format run by a Democrat operative host doesn't bother me at all!
@CatyRae   O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.  (from "The Star-Spangled Banner," fourth stanza)  Let it ride. When, in the end, when everything is racist, then nothing can be racist.  #CallingEverythingRacist

@CatyRae best of his campaign thus far - he's gonna destroy her in the debates even if CNN is moderating
@CatyRae depends when its scheduled, for this cycle they made the schedule about a year ago i think. Idk why i know this I'm not even american haha
@CatyRae haha it's such bullshit that it's on same time as NFL, definitely a ploy to keep viewers down bc they knew hillary is gonna choke

@chris_story 3x but they changed the repost ahead of us. but i could see how this would go viral and everyones feed be covered by bots
@chris_story @e out and about will test it in a few hours 
@chris_story @Zhanx upvote/downvote issue is fixed.
@chris_story ballsy man, undress and accept your upfroggers!
@chris_story I can write a script for that... 😬 
@chris_story i faulted washington post into prompting me for a username/password combination. After i get this computer setup again I was going to do the same to gab. (since i didn't realize i grabbed the wrong ip before)
@chris_story I see it 3x but one repost worked for all 3.
@chris_story i thought before you mentioned something last night you could repost everything, even reposts from other people, now not so much. But the reposts still show every time someone reposts and can flood your feed for a while
@chris_story i was mapping the connections last night. wow they are currently using a lot of external support to help this site out. Compared to other major sites (the tie in is google analytics )  http://sli.mg/J6oAsS
@chris_story it un-reposts.
@chris_story just got this on my time line and was able to repost it. 13 minutes after the first repost
@chris_story lets brreaak it
@chris_story ok fine leave something for me :) ok off the store 
@chris_story rapid click upvote and downvotes and finish with a downvote the user will see just an upvote in notifacations
@chris_story that did it right there
@chris_story thats how its becomes the flood then
@chris_story this issue has just recently been fixed by @e . All reposts will now show as "x,y, and z reposted....." 
@chris_story very well, ty. My BFF has breast/bone cancer. At least once a week, I take her shopping after her chemo treatments, today she was off from chemo and wanted to shop til we dropped.   She has more energy than I do. 💕 #LoveHerSoMuch 
@chris_story well i can tell you how this is gonna work, we will flood the site. 
@chris_story you are helping but you must also be willing to sacrifice little upfroggers for the cause... are you man enough?
@chris_story you post, i repost, you  delete your post and repost mine, i do the same 
@ChrisBaker Got to pay for the wall and he knows it. Trump bossed him in that meeting, guaranteed. America is back. #MAGA #MAGBA
@ChrisBaker Haha hope it works for you!
@ChrisBaker I HAVE BEEN THINKING THIS SAME THING THE LAST FEW DAYS! Hahah
@ChrisBaker I know but that egotestical prick won't be on it.
@ChrisBaker I remember Gad tweeting out a few screenshots of the notifications he received. I think if I recall Mil had a few of his podcasts demonetized too. Strange that they both had videos hit before the new ToS were announced.
@ChrisBaker I'm currently watching it all unfold on Twitter and Facebook as popular Youtubers report what videos have been demonetized.
@ChrisBaker JagYouAre, sir. Jag, you are. http://i.giphy.com/fNDKwCUXaev2U.gif #BritFam
@ChrisBaker the advertising narrative is a hoax, people respond to money, if the only way you can keep your income coming in is to make PC content, thats wot your do. there being forced into self censorship,  so youtube cant be accused of censorship. soros 101

@chrismackay  >elements of faith to something that you consider the only logical conclusion  Which are what?
@chrismackay  A gap in scientific knowledge is not proof of religious position. In fact this argument is known as God of Gaps. You simply pick a phenomena that you can't explain and plug your particular deity of choice in. Luckily the pool of gaps has shrunk to a spec since the days of Abraham.
@chrismackay  Assuming "already won" point is directed at those who don't respect your freedom to speak, then I have to wonder about your definition of "win". How do you win if they simply kill you or outbreed and outvote you?
@chrismackay  Assuming one could become religious without childhood indoctrination....
@chrismackay  Atheism is not a school of thought at all. We don't congregate on Sundays and chant in Latin. We don't share any particular beliefs as atheists. It is not a position in itself, but rather rejection of your position. 
@chrismackay  Beliefs are not "can be" shaped by parent. They "are" largely shaped by parents. Like I said, if what you say is true, 95% of the planet would be atheist.
@chrismackay  Careful, you keep that nihilism up, you'll join us beta fags soon.
@chrismackay  I don't think anyone was pissed off. And it is a rather serious point. If anti-left coalition is so upset by failing public morals and destruction of the family, then why not simply welcome Islam. All the Marxists and trannies will be hanging from the cranes the same night.
@chrismackay  I would love to hear a single "logical" argument that leads to god(s). The best I've heard so far was that that reason and evidence and "not the right tools" to tackle this question, but rather faith is. Which of course is just Special Pleading fallacy.
@chrismackay  Ideology cannot be evil, because ideology is not a moral agent. People (Marxists and trannies) who support that ideology are. And if so, why wouldn't you want them dead?
@chrismackay  If your argument that a divine big brother ideology is _useful_ (rather than true), because people are cattle and need to be coerced into doing and thinking what's good for them, then I don't really have an argument against it. But then why not just join Islam?
@chrismackay  If your rationale is that religion is _useful_ as a tool for coercing people to choices that are good for society, then it doesn't really matter which one you pick. Presumably you'd want to pick one that would have easier time dominating public life.
@chrismackay  It doesn't really matter if you got to church. What matters is what you believe in, and that is largely shaped by your parents in early childhood. It's not impossible to break from, but very hard.
@chrismackay  My parents are religious, but I wasn't raised as anyone. religion (or atheism) was never mentioned.
@chrismackay  That is incredibly naive POV. Children are effectively forced into a world view if it is presented to them as a fact, and no competing views provided. If it was that easy as you say, everyone would be atheist. As for atheists converting: LOL
@chrismackay  Then why not Islam? Mainstream media, universities, politicians and women are already primed for it.
@chrismackay  Why would I need to answer that question to examine beliefs of sub saharan goat herders about nature of the universe? I don't need to know the right answer to determine that some other answers are obviously false. It's ok to simply say "I don't know" and not pretend that you do.
@chrismackay  You're not willing to expand on your point, which would be necessary to prove or refute it. Ok, then just mute me and run away pretending that you've won, right after lecturing me on free market of ideas.
@chrismackay And if they don't, then what? Will you respect someone's right to speak, if they don't afford you the same?
@chrismackay I may have misread your previous response as directed at me.
@Christian  An answer to what? If your question is "but-but... muh hwite race!?" then yes, it is most definitely not the answer. And nobody actually thinks that all women are SJWs or feminazis. They're just looters during a race riot.

@chrono congrats
@chrono excellent! Once again, well done😉😘
@chrono love her!!
@chrono probably because you were being yourself rather than some fake twat! I think people are getting fed up in general of the same fake bullshit rhetoric 
@chrono that would be awesome! Having #BasedMom here would be 😍
@chrono well done!😉😘
@clarity can you try again in response to this post? thanks!
@claytonjay101 @og Ahh, don't fear the reaper is badass though  #TheBand
@claytonjay101 Have not had that, but I do love good butter.
@claytonjay101 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw-L0IAAxAg
@claytonjay101 I love it, fan of both.  #TheBand  OG
@claytonjay101 its still up in the air. Taking suggestions  #TheBand  OG
@claytonjay101 thanks man, it's not me though
@Cobaron I feel as if I should downvote this comment on principle :)
@Cobaron I heard Billie Joe hates Trump. Which is a shame because I actually liked Green Day.
@Cobaron It's a tad worrying. The whole point of this site is to be a haven for free speech for everybody and self-censorship. But as you noted we have some based devs/admins so we'll be fine.
@Cobaron Thank you for my 100th follow!
@Cobaron That's because I would never downvote you :/
@Cobaron That's what happened to me -_- lol
@code I love your profile picture!
@code No more immigrants from Syria and Libya. Extreme vetting for rest. Will ensure the over 20 countries that refuse to take back their deported citizens start doing so. Will complete BioMetric entry/exit Visa tracking system on land, sea and air.
@code Said maybe Hillary will be deported.  Hire 5K more border patrol agents.  More border patrol stations - significantly. Block funding for sanctuary cities.  Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws. Cancel Obama's amnesty for 5 Million illegals.
@code We are building a wall and Mexico is paying for it.
@code what's up my brotha, any updates for me??
@coffee_jitters91 Good luck! Nothing helps like legit practice in the world of technology. Side projects for fun and learning are a great way to get that practice.
@Complaint but with a healthy work ethic... So the added desire to do something to stop them from being happy.  If they just stayed home and worried, no one would care.
@Complaint he is not a libertarian. True.  I like libertarian ideas, responsible people generally do.
@Complaint He needs a good ass kicking.
@Complaint I like femur better than humerus. 
@Complaint I think everyone who has ever done anything is an opportunist. Otherwise they would be at home whining about their lack of opportunity.  So I wholeheartedly agree!
@complaint I think the vast majority of people all have the same priorities but in different order
@Complaint Intolerance is a protective reflex centered around tribes.  The left is VERY intolerant of non left or "intolerant" people.  It's their tribe. They don't care if you don't think they are tolerant since you are not in their tribe.
@Complaint libertarian ideas become unpopular because they are unpredictable and risk aversion is a perfectly sensible survival strategy... Just not the most successful one.
@Complaint libertarian is unpredictable prosperity vs communisim's guaranteed poverty
@Complaint selfish if many are harmed to benefit few.  Selfless if self is harmed and others are benefitted. Or if harm is prevented or if most benefit.  Who is deserving for benefit from another's seizing an opportunity or are we all freeloaders together?
@Complaint the 2012 election had only 85 million participants of roughly 330 to 400 million people
@Complaint the beauty of it is that I'm not sure I am describing Trump either.   I am reasonably certain (based on prior performance) that an orangutan would do a better job than Hillary.  Until we change our electoral system, libertarians don't have much chance. 
@Complaint this is big for Johnson. Really really big. And stiff too. And I'm gone..
@Complaint This is kinda big deal, and hardly anyone cares
@Complaint.  And selfish is bad? Is it better if someone has it forced on them? If he is doing it for his kids is it selfish?  Taking an opportunity to prevent a worse person to get it who would abuse, it is selfless.  Unless they want it then it is selfish.  
@connor it is, in the settings menu, the notifications bar is only for your email and not in site. You can make it so that you get 0 notifications via email. I have told the team to make this more clear and obvious in the wording for future reference. Thanks :)
@ConnorH93 But wasn`t there a resolution by EU not so long ago to fine countries that don`t fall in line with the open borders policy?
@ConnorWiseman Disabled AdBlock on Full30.com explicitly. It was effective in blocking all ads on the site. Youtube can stuff it though.
@ConnorWiseman Monster is insanely long at 75 eps. Even SDF Macross was half that. It's one of those Ugh Never Again things.
@Conzoop Cultural Marxism. Think of how racially motivated the alt right is; now the cultural Marxists..
@cooper that your channel? watching it now
@cooper well subscribed now thanks
@corgi @Furrrealz SHE'S HERE
@corgi @Furrrealz will be your new mother!
@corgi Don't worry. She'll be back.
@corgi Hi and Welcome! Nice to have you here on #Gab Look forward to gabbing and getting to know you!
@Corgi I think @Furrrealz would love you.
@corgi Now you just need a dank corgi pic
@Cornervizion baby's first Pepe https://i.sli.mg/gAIWgQ.jpg
@Cornervizion Praise Kek. Amen.
@Cough that's all up to @Furrrealz   #TheBand  OG
@Cough Wow lol. There's so much wrong with that I don't even know where to begin. 
@CreightonJK check out #gabchangelog to see what magic @e is up to   #GabTips
@CreightonJK hey
@CreightonJK I barely watch him, but this was actually not bad
@CreightonJK you can just click on hashtags fam, takes you straight there 😀   #GabTips
@CreightonJK.   Like The Boss he is. 
@cribdeath @rose and @themotherface  My three #GabCrushes.  
@CribDeath anytime my dear. You're still my first Gab Crush. 
@CribDeath Das cold fam
@CribDeath ill kill u
@CribDeath shut up
@Cringenado Far too polite, however accurate may be.
@Ctomp513  by the looks from that picture I need to put more of that growth into my penis 😂
@Ctomp513  what did I miss? Someone messing with our @shannonmontague?  #TheBand  OG
@Ctomp513 @rarepepe *
@Ctomp513 actually, here in the middle east they have 2-4 wifes and each 7-8 kids. Thats 1 big family. 
@Ctomp513 And this is where it went wrong, I am born Dutch( holland), but traveled the world,  My Aus friends tell me is is becoming more of a problem. Some areas masove rape rise and intimidation by muslims. 
@Ctomp513 are you from Conway or are you in school up there? Born and raised here in NLR.  #TheBand  OG
@Ctomp513 Are you implying that I am the one doing the kidding? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? CarlCuck never kids. Yeah I am kidding. #OhCarl 
@Ctomp513 assault laptops = alt-right pepe meme? 😂
@Ctomp513 awesome, its such a small world. Love that another person of the #GabFam is from Arkansas.  #TheBand  OG
@Ctomp513 By miles. 
@Ctomp513 Did I say that? Dont take my dirt wrong. Am not a natural shitposter or idiot
@Ctomp513 did not expect you to. But just had t say it
@Ctomp513 Excellent!!
@Ctomp513 forgiven.🙏 I send reply to your email also.
@Ctomp513 found it?
@Ctomp513 Haha. Oh I'll take a kiss any day. Lol. French you say?  You Gab girls are going to be the death of me. 
@Ctomp513 Hi. Ok there?
@Ctomp513 hows that?
@Ctomp513 I did
@Ctomp513 I know, I know. But I see a button and I have to click it.
@Ctomp513 I love this pic. He really is such a blue-collar billionaire...fast food with a plate! Lol #TrumpEffect
@Ctomp513 I replied
@Ctomp513 I'm a favorite?!   https://i.sli.mg/R2eTjt.jpg
@Ctomp513 It's okay now the problem seems to be sorted :-p
@Ctomp513 It's spelled Sharona 
@Ctomp513 just... Wear a red shirt???
@Ctomp513 Let them golf. Obama has given up and anytime on the back nine will piss more people off to vote Trump. Even Obama is doing his part to #MAGA. #OhCarl #GabNation
@Ctomp513 look up my name with location Bahrain. You'l find it
@Ctomp513 Luckily rhe USA is far away for many to travel, like Australia, so from middle east its not an easy trip. The big problem is that many middle east women travel to USA and Europe to deliver their babies. And get US or EU passports. Many years they do this now. So slowly they infiltrate
@Ctomp513 no worries. 😘 
@Ctomp513 Now this is nutrition advice I can get behind. 
@Ctomp513 Or it could be from My Sharona 
@Ctomp513 Same here #GabFam  #TheBand  OG
@Ctomp513 So are you dear. Hugs.   Btw why are there no good hug emojis?  
@Ctomp513 sometimes I wish it were the real Carl. The guy cracks me up to no end. Mainly cause one simple line completely turned him into a complete mockery. A taste of their own medicine. #OhCarl
@Ctomp513 SONOFABITCH I DID IT AGAIN. Tried to click on the radio buttons in the image. Witchcraftery you keep posting.
@Ctomp513 Thank you Crystal. 
@Ctomp513 Thanks dear!
@Ctomp513 Thanks for the shout out...seriously appreciated.
@Ctomp513 Thanks I appreciate that! Yep it's killary. It's all butthurt because i downvoted his overtly sexual(and particularly offensive) trolling. I think he lives in his mum's basement and drops flies into spider webs. he's vile. I have him blocked so I didn't notice. 
@Ctomp513 that's my husband. lol I'd hope he liked how I looked. 
@Ctomp513 Uhh yeah? They say they tell the truth. Why should I not believe them? They're on TV afterall. #OhCarl #CNNFactFinders
@Ctomp513 we all do but remain very selective. Everyone likes a compliment. As long as it is well meant.
@Ctomp513 Well, these two are married...
@Ctomp513 Wow, you sound serious.
@Ctomp513 Yeah the truth hurts doesn't it? CNN makes me cry too with their extreme truth bombs. #OhCarl
@Ctomp513 you alomst had me fooled. 
@Ctomp513 you failed to ask me? Bad girl.
@Ctomp513 you read my email?
@Ctomp513 🖐 high five 
@Ctomp513 😎
@Cuckold Im better than you. Foot fag. 
@Cuckold no

@curlytoot @b  Green  OG
@curlytoot a lot of news pundits will be hung over and hairless on the morning....
@curlytoot Because Leftists are brain dead idiots!
@curlytoot cheers! It came about when I could not pronounce "hippocampus"
@curlytoot Dang. Will definitely be checking it out then. 
@curlytoot Exes make problems. But honestly things always get better. It always sucks in the moment but later on you'll probably be happier. 
@curlytoot French horn is one of my favourites in the brass section, good on you!
@curlytoot Going to have to check out tomorrow or Friday! Is this one going down in history? 
@curlytoot great question....
@curlytoot hahaha! I know, right? 
@curlytoot He has no policy specifics they LIKE, so therefore it means he has no policy specifics at all. #LiberalLogic
@curlytoot I'm looking at the flag icon as an ironic joke by @a ...lol I'll never use it! Isn't that why we're all excited to be here & not be censored? If I see something I don't like I'll just keep scrollin! ;)  #SpeakFreely #GabFam
@curlytoot I'm using GoogleKeep to do the same thing. Some gabs contain really useful info/links, and I'd like to be able to use a gab as a point of reference instead of having to duplicate it elsewhere. 
@curlytoot I've come to the conclusion that everything the Democrats blame the Republicans for is stuff the Democrats are actually guilty of.
@curlytoot Interesting. I just noticed that too. Flag my reply and let's see what happens.
@curlytoot Language comprehension issues. #TrumpLive
@curlytoot Leftists lack ability to be honest,even to themselves.
@curlytoot lmao. my dyslexia turns into a bitch when I've had drinks and exhaustion sets in. Thanks for the heads up, brother. I can always count on you   #TheBand  OG
@curlytoot Me too..the Trolls will love that button..smh 
@curlytoot My day is going great, try for asking. How are you?
@curlytoot No probably. We've all been is shitty places after breakups. Just k ow your not alone and if you need anything you have people that will support you.   Glad my words could help. 
@curlytoot That's Awesome!! Congratulations on living your dream 😀
@curlytoot That's really cool, what do you play?
@curlytoot The fart I let this morning did more for Mexico relations than Berry has.
@curlytoot Unicorn blood.
@curlytoot who knows, maybe you'll meet the one on Gab :) 
@curlytoot Yeah, rather not. Let's use it on the #shills and #cucks instead. #MAGA on fellow #Centipede!
@cv Heck yes. Auburn isn't that great this year.
@cv I'd watch that. Him and Big Mike (Moochelles pre-trans name) could sob and hold the girls and talk about how 'Whitey be trippin'' and such. 
@cv I'm voting for #Trump, and since I don't like to argue with people about my political beliefs, I think it's best I unfollow you.  
@cv Of course there is - the wall pays for itself like 4x within the first year of its creation. The whole argument is just so dumb - 12 billion is chump change.
@cv You're welcome! I'm taking an "Islam in America" class and am learning new things. 
@CW #ThoughtCrime
@CW *Sigh* We're loosing our rights. It looks as though we all need to purchase an island, name it #Gab, and relocate...if we want to be uncensored. 
@CW @a the time has come for GabTube. 
@CW After #Gab takes over the world, it will be time to release #GabView. :)
@CW christ seriously
@CW Cutting off conservative/alternative income streams to either strangle them into conformity or drive them out of the marketplace altogether.   Total war. 
@CW define controversial!
@CW Google can't allow those evil conservatives to take their money... social justice demands that only good progressives get them Google bux for videos about cisgender bigotry and the need for trans bathroom rights. 
@CW Hmmm...sounds like a #Gabromance. 
@CW I've heard reports on one lady's acne video, and another guys depression video's also got the axe. It's just more censorship.
@CW It's the only way without setting up a Gab style YouTube. I can see a future with parallel systems competing for hearts and minds of viewers and advertisers. Can also see the one where we all get shunted for dissent and exiled. 
@CW Nooooooo hahahaha
@CW not just political, youtube have corporate relationships so they won't allow negative reviews of their products
@CW not just Twitter...they're out to pacify the whole internet 
@CW pretty sure thats the MBA, workplace sensitive way of saying:  "Just because" or "cause we say so"  
@CW This is the YouTube equivalent of a bank fee. Its a way for YouTube/Google to justify keeping the revenue from ads they will still play in house. Shady.
@CW True, having gab.ai and gab.tv would be great. And @a profile should be under gab.guru. :)
@CW Unfortunately not, speaking from experience. ;)
@CW Video's will always be sensitive to a nutcase or 2, so you will always lose, no matter what you post.
@CW Wow, YouTube's really fell far from the ladder.
@CW Wow. Scary. 
@CW Yup.  It is already being used to shut down monetization on multiple avenues.  I think they may be going as far as to say excessive swearing is 'controversial' as I've seen positive game reviews shut down for it.
@cyberglion, you'll have to excuse me, I need to tendie to this cough I've had for over a year!  🐔🐔🐔  #Trump #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/grcYk1
@Cyborgwolf  Put your fucking dick out NOW!
@Cyborgwolf Im not #gabqueer
@DaltonEdwards you're awesome. Which device and possible a ss?
@Daniel Got mine around a week ago and have almost entirely stopped using twitter. It's great here.
@Daniel I just used it on you, so me.
@Daniel Literally haven't even watched more than a quarter of the DVDs I have brought but I still buy them. #Addicted
@Daniel Neither, set up a plex server buy a couple 8 gig hard drives and get digital copies of what you want in blu ray or 1080p resolution
@Daniel Then you have to go Blu Ray, it's not even arguable.
@DanielHumphreys I have to keep my "author platforms" on Twitter and FB.  So that's one way I plan to utilize those social media prisons.  Use them to compare what I see and hear to the #SpeakFreely platform that is my #GabFam
@DanielHumphreys Not so sure about Amazon, but Smashwords, absolutely.  But if I were running an Amazon free promo day, I'd drop the URL in to see how many engagements I received on a Gab. Someone willing to give that extra click is showing serious interest.
@dannyblue  It made you cry tears of joy for a new America   #TrumpLive
@dannyblue holy shit. i need to give the multitasking a rest. guess i'll leave it for everyone to laugh at though!
@dannyblue I got 99 problems, but 100 followers aint one. 🐸
@dannyblue Oh, you better believe I will.  Man, that last season finale left me screaming.  I want more Saul.  #BetterCallSaul
@dannyblue well shit, I just posted the exact same quote. 
@DannySmith I'm just going to have a headche that would kill 5 small children for the next couple of hours, I'll be right.
@DannySmith No, an anti-psychotic and a pain killer they fsuc with my head if I have 'em in my system together.
@DannySmith Only if you can codify confusion.
@daph Where can I get some of those to pass out on my campus?! 
@DarkRazorZ can't see
@DarkRazorZ downvoted 
@Darth_Bluto I don't understand a thing you said, man! But I support your right to say it! 😃 
@Darth_Bluto I have been weighed, I have been measured, and I have absolutely been found wanting. God save me, if it is right that he should do so.
@Darth_Bluto It's important to eat plenty of meals rich in Vitamin Steak. 
@Darth_Bluto looks like it :)
@Darth_Bluto Shit,I forgot #NoHomo
@Darth_Bluto Thanks! The feeling is mutual. :)
@DavidGX "We're being a dolphin, this isn't offensive, right?" Bah!
@DavidGX hence the beta waitlist lol 
@DavidGX Um, did you just appropriate dolphin culture?! Fucking shitlord delete this REEEEE-
@DavidGX What bothers me about this TOS change with YouTube is as a fan of a lot of freaky conspiracy channels, I'm wondering if they are going to pull out, or modify their claims that Hillary is a lizard person.
@DavidGX You could seriously make a whole channel around this. I cried watching it. gahaha
@DavidJ ayeee oooo
@DavidJ That ones on my playlist for life.
@daww ditto!
@Daww i almost caught them all too
@Daww i put an appeal again a week ago...still no response - there must be thousands lol
@Daww i would've caught him on pokemon go eventually but got banned 😢 
@daymin Hi cutie pie, welcome to Gab. Come on in the waters fine.
@daymin is it open beta?
@DB  A FAM  FAQ page would be great Status on members updates on info  Such as the phone app Or any Tech or support info.
@DB  Sir on these links you forwarded me is it Ok to share with friends (By DM ), not a post just wanted to check with you first
@DB #ISecond #SecondAmendmentPeople
@DB #SecondAmendmentPeople
@DB Thanks appreciate that 
@DB Ya know, I honestly believe he thinks like that. He's a despicable creature!  #DeportHimFromThePlanet
@DBR96A I second this proposal (or nth it, didn't check to see if there were other replies :)
@DBR96A yea pretty much....Donald been in the limelight too long..too savy
@DeadNotSleeping #Londonistan is the same 
@DeadNotSleeping (I didn't care for that episode)
@DeadNotSleeping 3 year BSc in that shit mate
@DeadNotSleeping @Aerock word limitation, no person does enough work to merit %1 of wealth as it is based on gdp. It is bought with workers/producers etc. I'm not a proponent for high taxes but I'm not blind to how money floods up.
@DeadNotSleeping @Don   Brother, we are all welcome to wander the Northern Wastelands of the Great Eternal Caliphate 
@DeadNotSleeping @LiraKitty Into the badlands is more... martial arty 'matrix' meets badlands? sans computer.
@DeadNotSleeping @oath https://i.sli.mg/wCyaaI.png  This might help more 
@DeadNotSleeping are you looking for an ssh client on windows?
@DeadNotSleeping are you messing with me?  did @a really say my handle? cos that would be so cool 😂   
@DeadNotSleeping attaboy.  ubuntu i hope
@DeadNotSleeping beautiful! I can't believe I missed that. 
@DeadNotSleeping BUT MUH HOMEOPATHY 
@DeadNotSleeping can you clarify please, is he actuality a shit (red nose wearing) clown? or was it just a general derogatory term. *this is a active word police zone*  huh? wot u mean this aint twitter?
@DeadNotSleeping can you run an strace with it and see what files it is actually trying to open?  
@DeadNotSleeping christ how old are you lol
@DeadNotSleeping don't need to, I'm in your brain
@DeadNotSleeping Don't you think she looks tired?
@DeadNotSleeping everyone's brain, nanobots
@DeadNotSleeping For. Cucking is exhausting work. Plus I gotta go back all the ancient stuff and copy that stuff onto note pad. so I can keep cucking going and keep it fresh. #OhCarl #CharacterDevelopment
@DeadNotSleeping g'night
@DeadNotSleeping good to see your mom helps you with your shitposting then, say thank you to her for me, TWICE, she'll know about the second thank you
@DeadNotSleeping HAH jokes on you! i have two dads instead of a mum!!!!!!!!!! he/she transitioned ages ago #sadtimes 
@DeadNotSleeping haha, yeah I drink a ton of water now. I was just hoping for some jedi nutrition tip from @shorty cause you're kidneys not working right is some terrible shit.
@DeadNotSleeping Huh, I shall have to look into it! Right now I am just impatiently waiting for Lucifer to come back.
@DeadNotSleeping I buy and sell properties.
@DeadNotSleeping I can't really say he is too old as I am quite fond of the first doctor. I do feel in some places they are trying too hard with his scripting but I do enjoy Capaldi a good bit. I definitely recommend catching up that is all I will say.
@DeadNotSleeping I do have to admit I would rather a good show be cancelled than to have them pull a Dollhouse though.
@DeadNotSleeping I don't know what that is my parents wouldn't get me a Super NES but I see what you mean
@DeadNotSleeping I forgive you. Now go and vote Hillary 2016.
@DeadNotSleeping I like the term 'UK Bound' as if somehow they're our problem because "They said they want to go to the UK"... Provocative placement. Vindictive slug, that Mayor. #BritFam
@DeadNotSleeping I still haven't convinced the husband to give it a chance. Maybe someday. *sigh*
@DeadNotSleeping I would take shifts. it would be great either ways. #OhCarl
@DeadNotSleeping id love the earth top be flat, even just to beat neil degrasse tyson to death with a globe.
@DeadNotSleeping Indeed! Oddly enough, when he first came on, my husband and stopped watching for a few seasons. When we came back, we fell in love. There will never be another David nor another Katherine. They truly were the dynamic duo!
@DeadNotSleeping is this for real???
@DeadNotSleeping Islam may not be the religion of peace, but it's certainly the religion of barbarians. They are totally Haram. 
@DeadNotSleeping It probably doesn't slide in so nicely lol
@DeadNotSleeping It's hard to keep up with who's fighting who right now... My guess is this is how it'll stay pretty much, with territory swaying from one faction to another and back until #Trump. Then decisive action in favour of Allies will commence. Swiftly. If Hillary, ISIS will grow.
@DeadNotSleeping it's one of those areas with not enough good quality research, which is a shame
@DeadNotSleeping Jeb! Jeb!
@DeadNotSleeping Just because the numbers are big doesn't mean something inherently wrong or shady is going on. I have never heard that money floods up. Do you have a paper or book I can read to support that?  Most money is taxed and wasted by inefficient gov programs like (Canada) healthcare
@DeadNotSleeping lack of glutathione is why asians get drunk really easily 
@DeadNotSleeping LIKING DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING YOU CUCK @CarlCuck
@DeadNotSleeping lol you think I'm trolling. 
@DeadNotSleeping Looks like I struck a nerve.
@DeadNotSleeping never underestimate the feels from a spa jet up the butthole. 
@DeadNotSleeping Nice! Will check it out and get to my rp family before they disown me. <3 Was a pleasure speaking with you. Have fun!
@DeadNotSleeping No. Europe here.
@DeadNotSleeping nope, we don't have protected status here either. So much nutri-bollocks it's unreal.   And they're all #CtrlLeft-ies 
@DeadNotSleeping Noted.
@DeadNotSleeping oh god no.. lol
@DeadNotSleeping Oh Nigel what have you done? You destroyed Britain and giving it back to Britain. #OhCarl
@DeadNotSleeping One of the most beautiful scenes for that season. Also very heartbreaking considering all the pain, loved ones he had lost. It was one of the few moments he stops being stoic and admits the torment of being a demi-god.
@DeadNotSleeping Re: 'p.s.' I hadn't noticed.
@DeadNotSleeping Roflmao! What can I say, I try to stay one step ahead of the NSA at all times. Next thing you know you will find my pillow in your closet. ;) But really, Supernatural is one of those horses that should have just died a long time ago.
@DeadNotSleeping Shit. #shit
@DeadNotSleeping so offended people should leave #Gab?
@DeadNotSleeping some of the Frogs are alright - the government must think it's a great idea to move the guests in next to the Eurostar arrivals/departures so Calais shuts up  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/30/calais-locals-to-indefinitely-blockade-port-with-human-chain/
@DeadNotSleeping something like that 😆 ask me again when we have DM. #doxxing #OPSEC
@DeadNotSleeping Still Alive, Code Monkey, and IKEA are also good JC jams!
@DeadNotSleeping Straight in the sea, with concrete shoes. Invader scum.
@DeadNotSleeping that explains the outfit when I "bombed the shit out of you" I thought @deadnotsleeping's mom was just kinky
@DeadNotSleeping That is an interesting observation. How did you come to this conclusion?
@DeadNotSleeping that's all well and good, but are you sure curl is opening that file?  The error message suggests possibly otherwise.
@DeadNotSleeping The benefit is that you get to watch. And change everyone's culture because you don't want to be a part of it,  so they have to be a part of yours. We want Multi-Culture and if you don't assimilate we'll punish you for your defiance. It's for the greater good afterall #OhCarl 
@DeadNotSleeping The capital is already inundated with migrants who sleep rough in city parks, or under flyovers or railway bridges.  Riot police regularly destroy their illegal settlements, it is impossible to move them on because even if they are dispersed, they almost always come back again. 
@DeadNotSleeping the powers at be didnt want them to find out the earth is flat, 
@DeadNotSleeping Then you obviously never heard of slacktivism. The best activism. The sitting down and doing nothing kind. I'm fixing the world with these arbitrary click. #OhCarl #SavingTheWorldWithUpVotes
@DeadNotSleeping they'd better have great life insurance
@DeadNotSleeping This is why we can't have good things.
@DeadNotSleeping Top kek
@DeadNotSleeping Ugh, now that is a cruel question! Hmmm, doctor all the way....
@DeadNotSleeping Well now I have to check it out! Just what I need, yet another show to rabidly follow.
@DeadNotSleeping WHAT! tell them to stop, im trying to build a frog army!
@DeadNotSleeping when we get video on here, I'll show y'all.  The food trucks come outside the Zimbabwe Embassy every night to feed them - each religion does a different night - several hundred turn up and sleep nearby.
@DeadNotSleeping Why does this statement make me think of Supernatural?
@DeadNotSleeping you're probably my age lol
@DeadNotSleeping yup
@DeadNotSleeping yup. Like I said, ask me again when DMs are available
@deathconsciousness @teridax
@deathconsciousness gay
@Debs Ahh, the salty smell of Remoaner tears... Brings a cheery smile to face every time. It's like being at the seaside. Rule Britannia.
@Debs It did it again this morning and I jumped again. It's a great sound, but when you work in an office, there's always the thought maybe a frog got in.
@Debs It's a hateful rag. What a joke.
@Debs Watch a @farage speech video first, perhaps. Get yourself in the mood...
@dec I wasn't day one 🙁 
@dec nor the energy to get out of her death bed.
@dec To begin with I didn't believe it because of some of the dumber things he said. But now that I have watched a few rallies he seems more educated and obviously still better than a full on crook.
@dec 😺 
@degarmot Thanks!
@dekurizu Happy Birthday 
@dekurizu In 20 years time, we can only hope.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar   Hahaa!!  Exactly!
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar   The SJW victim culture is the absolute worst thing about being on the left/liberal side of the fence. Those folks don't represent a majority viewpoint, they're just loud and obnoxious children.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar  I'm laughing so fucking hard 😂😂😂
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar  that's a good one, but will it cut it with @Furrrealz   #TheBand  OG
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar  Wow I feel bad for you He's en fuego 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar "In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act." It's almost like that George Orwell fellow was prophetic, or something.

@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar burn the heretic!
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar But how will I handle not having the all-seeing gaze of the Trust & Safety Inquisition overseeing all?
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar but their names are all Karen. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Could you give me a hand with this? Don't worry, I'll give it back. #DadJokes

@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I believe it. I really do. I've enough horror movies in my head when i close my eyes already...but thanks.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I believe it. I've heard about this for years. The holy and ever righteous muzz find that having relations with "dancing boys" is an excuse for illicit sex that Allah approves of because for some unknown reason it isn't adultery or hoimosexuality. Pigs...filth...perverts.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I can't afford one of the microsoft ones, I'll use my desktop.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I did mine last night, I may do another once I'm in bed shortly, I'm not reporting sacks empty though.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I don't know what dwarven means, but i LIKE IT.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I would not have started if I did not plan on taking it all the way. :) Great to know, we will need the best and brightest to win. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I'll be the yin to your yang.  You throw them out & I'll mutter something like "Unfortunately, this is what happens when you shill" as you Leonidas kick those fucks through the side door.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I'm assuming you were meeting to determine the quality of the wall they were paying for. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar I've got too much heart I guess...I need to toughen up. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar if you could direct that at California that'd be great.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar It is even more beautiful than the Tootsie Roll Massacre video :)
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar It's fucking hard. The environment is so toxic. I just need to kick myself in the ass for school so I can take charge of the direction of my life.  #TooScaredToMakeDecisions
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Kansas huh? Most of our friends are Chiefs fans, since we live in KS. We like them, but root for #Seahawks. We watched Lions when Suh was there. College=husband roots Huskers, but I need a backup plan. Lol.. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar lol not intended to be at the same time but he is here. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Maybe this is what heaven is like. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar mine will be back this fall. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar My sons call me he queen of bad jokes.   #IAmSoThere
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Of course. I revel in them. They make my kid's groan and want to dive out of a moving car. #DadJokes
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Oh dear, it's Scots-gaelic I like the sound of better
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar oh stop with the flattery. you had me at Whiskey.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar one of Mad Granny Merkel's guests raped a young boy at a pool and excused it by saying it was a "Sexual emergency" because he hadn't seen his wife since he left her to go to Germany.....he couldn't freaking masturbate? I despise these people. How will they ever assimilate?
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar oops , on the net.  Can't watch and type at the same time! 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Original Six!
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar roger that.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Same it is a classic.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar she's bad ass, #TheBand wouldn't be a thing without her and a night of drinks.  OG
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar So many attractive ladies here. It's like smart hot girl island. 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar So they dont even wait for affirmative consent? 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar So, indirectly. She would never directly support such activity, but that might be the result of her policies. However, how did you conclude she would favor the Muslims over the gays?
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Socialism Kills
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar sorry! It's a good one, his best yet. Catch it later in the net. #Inspired 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Sports? Like football? Who do you root for? #FootballFever #NoSF49
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar spot on. I've said for years that when my grands came here they were dying to become Americans, not Hungarian americans..Americans period. If people don't want to be Americans then they need to stay away.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar thank you friend.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar That makes you the dad I never had
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar That would depend on who is doing the check ... ;-)
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar That's the sport of finding their trigger. Because their beliefs are identity based, it's usually easy to find. I often default to vauge references to race and their minds fill in the rest. Pow, they go nuts.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar The fundamental difference is that, while #Gab may ultimately become an echo chamber, it at least has the potential to be otherwise through it's strong support of Freedom of Speech. Other systems have enforced echo chambers through aggressively moderated discourse.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar the wall is going to be beautiful, they will come but they will come the legal way and we will #Maga ! In all honesty, FB is compromised of people of my choosing and I like the people here better! #GreatMinds is right! #GabFam 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar these are all awesome. My daughter is too young yet for this humor but I need to save them because that's what dads are for!
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar this whole post is racist  OG
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Waiting for the #TheBand to release their debut album!!! 
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar was none. Guy said, #GabQueers needs to be a thing. Why not? Let's throw down some #GayPride and mix shit up.

@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar well she is white female of course your triggers, cause she is strong @furrrealz
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Well, 'clean' is a strong word with the profanity and negative talk about specific groups. However, I have been using the Internet longer than the tumblrettes. Coarse language does not scare me, even if I do not personally engage in it. Language police isn't my job.
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar what game do you run?  #TheBand  OG
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar WTF  @Furrrealz  Furrrealz!!!! DWT  #TheBand  OG  
@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar Yes. I love it.

@DeltaWhiskeyTemplar 💕 🇺🇸 #NobodyMessesWithMyCubs 
@Dennace Its sad that at how true this is 😐
@Des  -Flagging posts is available now.   -Flagging a post will report it to us.   -Please do not abuse this feature   .
@Des  @nutbunny I Gabbed earlier, that I went to the USA with 500 K USD, Bought land , build a house on it , worked for 4 years trying to get a green card. left empty pocket.
@Des  @nutbunny If they all leave we can make this place a bit better.
@Des  Those are probably good for a lot of things. 😃 
@Des  Yes 😂  I mean, they DID prevent this potential threat with these Thulsi brothers. They are working in the background. Of course that is not to say they'll always catch issues in time, but I do have faith in their ability. Public only found out about these guys when the arrests hit the news.
@Des "When you see a strong horse and a weak horse you are naturally drawn to the strong horse." - Osama Bin Laden.   It's fairly easy to see the mistake we have been making.  Time to change.  #MAGA
@Des #Bleck! Image I didn't need.
@Des #LOL. That's a T-shirt I don't have!   #BlackEyesLately?
@Des 130 degrees? Where at?  OG
@Des 2 for sure, then we look at the status and go from there.
@Des @nat I'll send cigar pics when I get to work
@Des @nutbunny 1 of the reasons I left Europe actually. Have been focusing for some time where we could go.
@Des @nutbunny And I thought SA was getting bad when I left.
@Des @nutbunny spend 7 years there
@Des @nutbunny You advising I should have done the same. Back then I still had a six pack, I repeat , back then.
@Des @shorty @nat Am confused but OK 😕 
@Des @shorty I knew what ya meant :p
@Des also one of the best countries for penis transplants, since the tribes circumsise young teenagers with blunt instruments and fuck up regularly  But that's how you spell that sausage? I'm not even going to try lol
@Des Also, nowadays the keyboard is really the only platform for free speech. Even for #Rubin. Keyboards uploaded his videos. Keyboards navigate to his videos. Other than being in front of a camera what does he use?
@Des Am a bit confused I must say. 
@Des And I don't want to be judged as xenophobic, but these foreigners bring with them the compulsory burka daywear, FGM, as well as... guess what... DAESH agents.
@Des And shredded penisses. Checking out some platform boundaries I guess.
@Des Are you meeting up with any #GAB members over here?
@Des As someone from a MuslimFamily in SA, my experience has been that most women dress normal western. Jeans tshirt blouses dresses. On sabbath,religiousHolidays & observances like funerals etc. they bring out scarves, &more modest clothing. Burkas during actual private prayer
@Des Bah! 
@Des Because it's a middle eastern religion and the ones who are perceived to be the most Islamic are the Arabs? XD That's how it works. They ape the arabs because they think it's how it's meant to be done. 
@Des Been there. Our first cruise was with them. Went to Celebrity and loved it! I hope you have a wonderful time!
@Des Best plan: pack layers. Then if it's 85 F you can wear one layer; 50 F three.  Love to have 30s!
@Des better this way, no dust collector on my back, hahaha
@Des Birding, do a search for Florida's Great Birding Trail" and be sure to activate your rental car's GPS to be able to find all of the locations. Circle B Bar, almost any "Wetlands" and the west coast offers Fort DeSoto. 
@Des BTW, you're not pregnant or thinking of getting that way, are you? #Zika is a concern.
@Des But should kick her butt for un-frogging me. LOL Will get over it. 
@Des by choice?
@Des C- he did better than most to remain balance, but still repeated the usual bullshit the mainstream does.
@Des can I bring my frenchie , he would love to play with them. 
@Des Carnival leaves out of my area: Port Canaveral. Wish you had booked that!
@Des Central Florida did you hear that? We could do a meet and greet for Des and her family.   Keep reminding us as you get closer to arrival date, @Des and we'll see who can show up somewhere!
@Des Correction: 8 lbs. 15 oz. Bad fingers!
@Des crap. I just pushed yours. What happened?
@Des Cruising? Which cruise line? I prefer Celebrity myself. 
@Des Cuck Overlord.
@Des Didn't follow, some idiot even reposted this. Well, that was too graphic for me. 
@Des ditto, it was awesome. 
@Des Do you have your stateroom assignment? Where are you in the ship? Ends tend to be more up and down . Middle is best, and middle floors. Do you know if you get seasick?
@Des Don't worry #GabFam coming in stat with an intervention. We gotchoo
@Des Done!
@Des downsizing by 10%- 50% 90%?
@Des exactly.  :/
@Des Exactly.  And everyone is gonna press it.  You don't give people buttons and not expect them to press them.  What's this button do? No, Dee-Dee! *Boom*  #DontPressTheHazardButton
@Des Excellent! No worries then!  I had two sons and that was enough. Love them dearly but two C-sections was one too many!
@Des First one after 27 hours of induced labor! #TiredMomma
@Des Flagging a post
@Des for like a person I had a discussion earlier this morning. Or yes bad shit or abuse send.  I agree Buttons are a bit small, ecspect me to push buttons with my pinky.
@Des For rodents.  And the rest of the family still comes around! It is like they have a death wish... them and the squirrels. 
@Des For the tomboy I'm sure you can find a zip line somewhere in the area, or maybe an off road vehicle course?
@Des For what? That's just not right. #DoNotDownFrogDes
@Des Forscience, over here on the Space Coast we have the space museum where you can see the history of our space exploration. There's also some birding over here and beaches and Ron Jon's Surf Shop.
@Des Fully agree, then again I don't have a problem with the makeup, I aim to install a chiller for the pool this winter, so I can keep the temperature down.
@Des Good morning
@Des Good one ;D
@Des Good point. 
@Des Gross!!!
@Des haha, nope looks more like a rare pokemon. 
@Des hahaha
@Des hahaha, good one.  You will never hear that from me believe me. By the way. May be visiting Dubai next week. Just a day trip though. Jebal Ali area. 
@Des HAHAHAHA 
@Des he will be is he keeps coming to my bar
@Des he's new here so need to help them out a bit
@Des Here we go http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/twin-brothers-in-joburg-court-on-terrorism-charges-2044096  https://www.enca.com/south-africa/shocking-evidence-of-thulsie-twins-terror-plans-revealed-in-court
@Des hey, if they kick you off, I'll "hazard" myself and we'll go down together. Deal?
@Des holy crap. Where do you live, the sun? Or AU? Same thing. 
@Des How can I forget you, yes,  you and me, thus 2.
@Des how hot is it now? A billion degrees? I feel for you, fam.
@Des However, something creepy to note is that recently we have been having an influx of people from northeast Africa, likeEgypt, Somalia, Ethiopia etc, with people who bring with them FGM &full burka daywear, you can spot them easily on the street. They are the ones that are ... a bit overdressed. 
@Des I agree. Live in Florida and hate the heat and humidity. Step out of my air conditioning and turn into a drip.   #WantSnow
@Des I almost got #Gabstoned a minute ago here on #Gab
@Des I am so tempted to buy one and wear it, just to spite them. 
@Des I can remeber you are overloaded so cannot run that fast. being 1.92mtr, I have long legs to chase you down.
@Des I don't agree with the ban. It's not on par with a garment like the niqab or burka. The latter should be banned because it's a security threat. 
@Des I don't even know how it happened, I felt bad afterwards for kind of going on autopilot during the itnerview and I wasn't sure if what I was saying would be valuable information to them hahaha
@Des I frequent middle class gathering places owned by Muslims. I can tell you one thing. ISIS, the media attention Islam is getting from the world press, is energizing them, even galvanizing them. Most signs are subtle, like more religious garb, but the way the men are talking is changing now.     
@Des I have my weaknesses, but nobody has noticed them yet, lmao
@Des I knew Islam was getting bigger in SA. But I didn't know it was this bad.
@Des I like him already, same here.
@Des I noticed, must be in the weather or water. Am taking care of it in a professional manor.
@Des I personally am not very religious any more so dont visit mosques to personally hear what's happening on the ground, but other devout Muslim friends&family have mentioned that this topic actually does come up & is denounced. SA Muslim institutions as a group have denounced this trend
@Des I remember you as a colony, don't worry  Also biltong and that curled up sausage are tasty af
@Des i see. to be honest, i don't know much about sa, i think. let's see. apartheid, that dude without legs who shot his girlfriend, and i like the chick from die antwoord. :|
@Des i wanted to upfrog you by 10 for this one
@Des I was skeptical at first too, but I am beginning to believe that she understands the extraordinary opportunity we have now, and is smart enough to take ownership of all that the UK might now achieve.  She's certainly a canny politician, and #Brexit is her best option now to keep her in power.
@Des I wonder what Klingons do with their cucks? Bet they're being oppressed. #OhCarl #StarTrekSafeSpaceNine
@Des I would not state that as fact. But I see that the type, topic and energy of the conversations is different. Older men fittening up. Younger men going to trad dress where before they wore sneakers & t-shirts with jeans. Avoidance of public eye-contact. Unease. Subtle changes.   
@Des I'll be your #MOFam
@Des I'm sorry you're hurting. I hope the surgery helps.
@Des Indeed. That's the problem with the arabisation of Islam and Wahhabism as a sect is gaining more power and influence. The same is happening in my country. A lot of those values are cultural and not religious per se. 
@Des is a confirmed #FlagFag sentence is eternity in the #GabTherapy program time now
@Des Jihadis sneak in via groups of "the wrong sort of people", you know those who decent people skinder about, people known in the community to be involved with crime, gangs, drugs; the bad eggs. They infiltrate while wearing a patina of holiness/goodness, & swing bad eggs with guilty consciences.
@Des Jordan wine from SA is so so so good
@Des Just thought of a paintball game or lazer tag game, for your tomboy. That is, if you don't mind welts showing after paintball while you're in your bathing suit.
@Des Like SJWs, they excuse bad behaviour because it's for a "greater good", and so thusly they erase any guilt in themselves
@Des Max Temperature     120 °  Not quite 130, but 120 is even hot here in Arkansas  OG
@Des Milo started off as a #KeyboardWarrior Really he still is when he uses.....the KEYBOARD to tap out his articles. What am I missing????
@Des more than one floating around today. 
@Des Most of us find wearing full daywear burka odd, but respect their choice to wear it (because we know they do it because they really badly want to be in God's good graces). 
@Des My guess (just a guess) is offensive material
@Des My Ragdoll approves.  He likes raw meat too!  
@Des nah, will go back to LC.  Depreciates a lot less also. 
@Des no way it was that hot  OG
@Des no way! Weed makes you fat. And slow.  Gotta COKE up to GET up!  
@Des No, actually have several Aus friends. But I do not wish to publicly shame her and there is no PM option here. Unless I find out she is shitposting about me in a serious way I just might.
@Des no, he's a filthy mudblood! #jokes
@Des no. i am @alon and @jesus .
@Des Nobody should be sad about not being part of a EU fam...   We're all #GabFam!
@Des Nope, no shaving required.
@Des Not a prob. Again, have a great time and remember to #GAB while onboard so we can #CruiseVicariously.
@Des Not from Watson yet. But from you, I did. So at least that's all good and well. 
@Des not kissed, but appologies go a long way
@Des now how will I take this today, coming from you ..... 3 here have tried to shipost me, was not impresed and decided it was becoming immature.  2 stopped Gabbing me.  
@Des NOWAY, Facial wise all I do in comb my hair, am 1 that has hair on my head and no gorilla suit for the rest. 
@Des oh, that's worse than the sun.
@Des Ok, didn't see that particular Thai one. Reminds me of of the first one I muted here yesterday. Some guy who posted gaping assholes. Well, that didn't stopped me from Gabbing, did it?  We're all going to die. I've prepared myself with a cancer bingo sheet. 
@Des Ok? is this where you expect me to climb on a rock and jump you?
@Des Oops wrong language #MEFam it should be
@Des Plan ahead. One hit equals three shots, and I don't mean paintball shots!   #BottomsUp
@Des Sadly German cars dont hold up here well. Am replacing a q7 at 3 years old. 
@Des Same here. But that's fine, I hate sharing smokes.  Those pics are haram!
@Des She asked my email to discuss something Australia or so, so gave her. Then I received a very unexpected email. I replied that I thus figured Aus. was not to be discussed and got called sick.  
@Des she is so awesome. Actually measured tone and looks at the evidence. You know, like a professional. I hope she gets on #gab some day
@Des Since he's a frequent flyer... If he's a smoker I bet he knows all the nasty cigarette pack pics from around the world.  Nasty photos on cigarette packs. I'm sorry if that was mistakable.
@Des so terrible. Thankfully, our heat broke and hasn't been that hot for the last week or two. 
@Des sorry so late, #RealLife gets in the way of my #GabSessions 
@Des Sorry, my fault. I didn't really pay attention. You're no BritFam. I was about smoking in general including cigarettes. 
@Des sounds like 50%
@Des South African Nomads - That sounds like an article. 
@Des Suffering with you.
@Des Sure! Let me know when I can find a where!
@Des Sure, but he's no little fucker, got clipped. Nah, he will actually play with them , he has 0 aggresion, any dog or cat  walking near him he is ready to play, no matter what size. 
@Des Sure. What are your interests? Birding, space shuttle stuff, antiques, science?
@Des Target practice for fledgling shitposters to engage.  It's all good.  #SpeakFreely
@Des Thank you, Desiree. :)
@Des thanks @anns_life I haven't been in touch today, new features popping up all over the place!! From what I'm gathering, this will be used to alert the team to porn, threats or anything against the "law" .. The compliance rules which will never apply to most #Gabbers #GabFam 
@Des Thanks, but I was too sleepy and grumpy to be brave. I fell asleep after pushing three times. Cephalo-pelvic disproportion: 9 lbs 15 ounces of beautiful boy.
@Des that is so unfortunate.  Where are you from?
@Des that was probably the most offensive part, and that we only exist on the Internet.  It's almost as if he forgets the Internet exists in the real world.  But not a bad effort.
@Des that will be her first ride in years then. Lol
@Des that's awesome! I want to visit Dubai one day. I have a few friends that have been and they say it's pretty cool to see. 
@Des that's the worst part about that area of the world... The humidity.
@Des Thats cool, i can see that going on, Oliver( yes thats his name), follows my pool boy around, come close to a door he growls. So far no stitches required.
@Des thats why she needs the nails to add to that. 
@Des The thing is that locals actually do give the foreigners a hard time, especially the Somalis and Pakistanis, but their lives back "home" are so shitty they rather tough it out here and risk xenophobic violence.
@Des Then paintball it is? Welts and all!   #Yeow!
@Des Then you'll have a great time! Remember that the departure day is hectic. Remember to keep your clothes for departing the ship out of the suitcase you pack & set out the previous night. People have left the ship in clothes borrowed, bought and pajamas because they forgot!
@Des There's more to it though. It's also giving the ones who don't have a choice the liberty to visit the beach. Small steps to freedom for women, in my opinion. The burkini corresponds with choice more than a burqa or a niqab will. 
@Des Those were the first ones I saw. Didn't work then, they were so much cheaper than here ;D
@Des Totally depends. Sometimes we actually wear jackets! Sometimes it's just a sweater.   #FingersCrossedForCOLD
@Des U know those colouredGuys that recently were arrested4suspected terrorism plotting here in SA? My brother was actually propositioned by1 of their friends; he told me the dude was fawning over the "next caliphate" and the "brave souls" doing "gods work". My bro told him to fuck off
@Des uae cid?
@Des very fitting
@Des Visit Saudi, where everything you wish for, you don't get.
@Des VPN will solve it
@Des Wait you can't eat cigars. Well you can, but it wouldn't be good for you would it? Hey @shorty how nutritional are cigars?
@Des Wanna trade "pics"? Are they all the same across EU?
@Des was still sleeping, i am running late as I had to go an jumpstart a friend. Just made it to the office now. Your man made t out to Frankfurt , delayed? 
@Des Wasn't talking of that kind of bottom...  Sorry.   Surgery of that sort will never be a problem for me. Wasn't over-gifted, nor under-gifted there. Of course a false pregnancy helped In that.
@Des We won't talk about sheep then....
@Des Well in this case warm...  My dog caught a chipmunk last month. Let's just say I was less than pleased. 
@Des Well, they target USA institutions because of their middle east involvement, Jewish institutions because of Israels involvement with Palestine, and malls because capitalist pigs abuse brown people - or some such SJW communist nonsense
@Des what are your thoughts on fresh seafood?
@Des what more can I ask for.
@Des will let you know, most likely Wednesday or Thursday
@Des WTF! Someone down frogged me on this! Must be a #Boobman
@Des WTF, isn't that like 250 F?
@Des yeah either way I'm in! So looking forward to making way above minimum wage
@Des Yeah, blame Wahabbism. From what I can understand, there is no need for a niqab or a burqa, and it is considered by some to be unislamic. That aspect is Arab culture propagated by Wahabbism. 
@Des Yeah, he really sounded no different than anyone else that wants to blast the #AltRight. Keyboard warriors and racists? That's the point. We never had a voice before. The keyboard is our only platform. 
@Des Yeah, I agree. I think his video did a big hit to his credibility. Not understanding that almost all of his viewers are Keyboard Warriors in some fashion is just ignorant. I suppose drone operators are keyboard warriors. 
@Des yeah, no. i like this one as an explanation:  https://heartiste.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ninetheses.jpg
@Des Yep, they're close. Port C is about thirty minutes from Cape C. It only takes thirty minutes because you have to go to the ridges to cross he rivers. As the crow flies, it's fifteen minutes.  L#GrowWings
@Des Yes most of us Muslims here in SA grew up respecting others of different faiths, a beneficial effect of living in a cosmopolitan society with different sorts of people. These crazies grow up in homogenous societies, and that breeds a disrespect for what is different
@Des you may think I am not the type, but really I dont care about status. When people visit our office I am the last one people would guess I am the ceo. 
@Des you should post it so we can share it
@Des 😍
@Des 😱
@Des 😱 the horror 😱
@Des, you pissed someone off?
@DesertElephant yeah you got a point there. Well maybe in the future once Gab has another huge explosion of users. Guy can dream
@Desmy My grape stealing dog  https://sli.mg/jWlzKE
@DevilDog  I'm sure this will me ALL over the MSM in seconds… (snark filter now off)
@DevilDog Didn't grow up here, my heart is in Kansas City.  Life sure would be much sweeter if I were a Patriot fan though.
@DevilDog https://i.sli.mg/FliojD.jpg
@DevilDog Interesting perspective that may very well be true.  
@DevilDog lol that's how they treat us though. We just want to follow the law and preserve our culture and suddenly we're racists. What a time to be alive.
@DevilDog Not just Obama, unfortunately. The establishment in general. They are going all out to subjugate us.
@DevilDog not trying to be rude or crude, but surely a man worth 4.5 billion dollars could easily fund his own campaign? I guess at least his money doesn't come from Saudi.
@DevilDog Perhaps he should talk to Natalie Maines of the now defunct Dixie Chicks before proceeding any further.  
@DevilDog PLEEEZZZEE SOMEBODY NOTICE MEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! - Colin Kaepernick
@DevilDog So not only is he a bush league dick-splat who is against our finest in blue, but he's a bad Muslim. I thought pork was still haram to them.
@DevilDog srsly. It's almost like there's immigration laws for a reason or something I guess.
@DevilDog The comments are amazing! #TrumpTrain rolling through!
@DevilDog yes and I have a special place of disdain reserved for stupid animals, especially those flying rats! Also the human variety of vermin which😉
@DevilDog You mean to tell me that recklessly allowing in people who hold anti-western values from countries compromised by terrorism was a mistake?! Say it ain't so!
@dindunuffin Absolutely! I've been shooting for almost 20 years and hand taught countless women (and men). I love that moment when they first pull the trigger and realize "I made that happen!" And every preconceived notion they had about guns goes right out the window. 
@dindunuffin he kept down voting my husband while up voting my stuff one night. Weird. Anyways you're welcome!
@dindunuffin I sincerely hope so.  This cannot be allowed to keep going at it's current pace or we're going to be in for some dark times.
@dindunuffin just started watching him 3hrs ago. he's fucking hilarious
@dindunuffin No, you aren't being a blather mouth. That is what #Gab is here for! Sorry I didn't answer sooner. Had to do "Mom" things.  😂 
@dindunuffin probably pretty accurate
@dindunuffin somebody has been down voting all your junk lol I'm up voting to offset it but I think it's Killary 
@dindunuffin The best part is they encourage you to fart after...like men NEED encouragement to fart, amirite?
@Dlssims , 9 Spicy Tendies, don't eat them all!  🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔  #Trump #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/sDtkrI
@docj literally pointless, empty calories in the worst form...
@DoctorMonkey Not sure why anyone here would mind an opinion being shared, that seems contradictory to the whole Gab feel/goal. 
@DoctorMonkey that's only the case if you're in a swing state
@DoctorMonkey why not vote 3rd party then?
@dogbert better than ever!  Did you know...  Chicken comes basically the same way...
@dogbert down the street....  Veritables (if you are into that stuff) come in different packaging...  Except asparagus.... It is the same.  Odd.  Asparagus finishes differently than steak.
@dogbert How was the steak?
@dogbert Thanks for your service!'n
@Don #FreedomFriday? Is this a momentous #Brexit thing? 
@Don #MAGBA
@Don #MasterCuck
@Don 659% statistics show people believe ending in 9 is better
@Don And guns, which might be the biggest turn on 😂#WomenOfGab
@Don Can you do one with this image?  https://i.sli.mg/7VuheS.jpg  OG
@Don Can't wait.
@Don dog is right, she looks like a giraffe with spina bifida.
@Don Hahahaha.... Here's one more 😉 
@Don hats off my man, free beer for you.
@Don He has a past of being corrupt and accepting bribes. Other than that he has always been subservient, weak. Perfect for Leather Daddy Hillary. mmmm can't wait til Guccifer leaks their amazon account and shows how many whips/ball gags they buy.  p.s. i'm a degenerate
@Don https://i.sli.mg/8UA3Q5.gif  But for the sake of British #nationalism, By God, great job #BritFam! https://i.sli.mg/eB3nPl.jpg  Hurrah for old Nosey!
@Don I actually like Farage as a person but not a big fan of his political stylings. As for the Guardian, no. I've sworn off. I had that paper delivered since university and stopped a couple of years ago in exasperation. Followed online for a while until it just got too much.
@Don I agree. He does need help. Mexico is in trouble and they are our neighbors. Its no coincidence that our crime goes up when their's goes up. The cartels need to be put in check.
@Don I definitely wouldn't trust him, given the company he keeps. If I were #TimKaine I'd probably be worried for my family's safety, also. Getting close to the Clintons can be physically dangerous.
@Don I do believe bitter Remainers are crying over today's economic news. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37242804
@Don I said hello, didn't check out his nuts, what with launching #GabQueers, seemed a bit overfamiliar ;-)
@Don I watched it live. I couldn't believe he said he was building the wall and there was crime from the cartels. He said this IN MEXICO. The cable channel news outlets went bonkers. It was epic. 
@Don In Sharia Europe, Muslims go wherever they please.
@Don It was a great moment. I agree.
@Don Like #FreedomFriesDay
@Don Mike Pence is a far better VP for sure
@Don Moi? I'm totes harmless.
@Don Nothing they cannot workout over a cup of tea.
@Don Preciate it fam
@Don Pull up the bridge I suggest
@Don scary for a minute, I can just see the team typing up a storm
@Don Set them off by telling them they'll be getting 72 raisins, not virgins.
@Don Shhhh! Don't tell them darling - they'll ALL want some!  *biscuits
@Don Thanks Don. Hello to you as well.
@Don Thanks 💕💕💕 
@Don That looks so satisfying
@Don That's absolutely f'ing perfect  Thank you, my friend  OG
@Don The US has already gone full retard with Obama. I love my country. But have gone full retard. And you know the rule, you never go full retard.
@Don this is bad ass  OG
@Don We are all supreme. Gods of own lives. Aspire for the tops Whether it's Top Don or Top Cuck. #OhCarl #Inspiring 
@Don We can't get too cocky but I haven't been so tempted to check out the Guardian comments section to see how it's going down (if comments are allowed which is increasingly rare these days) for ages.
@Don Well that took a couple seconds to sink in
@Don yeah fam grab us some flour?
@Don Yeah, I gotta give @CarlCuck some credit there even if he does live in his mom's basement.
@Don You think Turkey is gonna keep going full retard and fully invade Syria? Will the US not go complete pussy under Obama and save the Kurds?
@Don You're too good to me.
@Donna   sorry for being such a blather mouth. i don't get social things very well and do tend to go on. TMI and all that.
@Donna @a and @emily know that would break my heart. I trust them completely. But #IWasInPanicMode
@Donna @BasedJon honest question, my oldest son is getting old enough to notice people with special needs. and is starting to question about them. What is right a short and sweet answer i can give him that doesn't seem like I teaching him wrong. I want him to understand but at 8 its like what i do?
@Donna am also unhappy now, my glass is empty but should be resolved ones I get the cork out 
@Donna d's in law..one social worker, one private girls prep and then harvard..they both thought I was a hillbilly cannibal now Harvard and I are good but the other? I hope we made some headway at fam campout this summer. I hate discord..grew up with too much in my own life.
@Donna Everything ought to be debated and discussed. I just think GAB has too many right wing people here. Yes we all might have differing opinions but at the core, we all agree with each other. We need some way to get leftists here so we can avoid this becoming a rightist version of tumblr.
@Donna he would not live to tell about it and @emily knows better. #IWantTheMomDance 
@Donna hi Donna.  Aren't oils amazing?  And yes, we do have lots in common.  I've done some cross-stitch, but not much.  I liked it though.  Nice to meet you!
@Donna http://lolworthy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trump-building-wall-gif.gif
@Donna I have the song picked out, actually I have two. I will probably be melting on the floor instead of dancing but I want that moment, nonetheless! @a @emily 
@Donna I wish there were more people I can discuss and debate with though 
@Donna if i said life isn't fair my wife would kill me
@Donna maybe try some frankincense if it's a really stubborn wart. I've been trying to use the more natural methods too-it's so nice not to have to run get a prescription all the time to fix things.
@Donna mine all started adult life as libs but wised up son after being on their own. Their better halves though..I just don't get it..one is fundraiser for lib causes they live in Seattle.Nice guy I like him but jeeze! 
@Donna No trolls are cool. Trolls make the internet, interesting. #SortOfAMiloQuote @m
@Donna not yet! we were just trolling 🐸
@Donna that works. Gets to the point and leaves only a bit of wiggle room for questions. Which at this point all i here is why is this like this. why why why why... at least 500 times a day.
@Donna The trolls will come first probably, then some journalists, then everyone else. That or we will become rightist tumblr.
@Donna vicious 
@Donna when we do you'll get an invitation don't worry! 
@Donna Which is what I love about Trump!! I'm farther right, but I'm an American first. And we have a lot to fight for, together, that we ALL care about. So much common ground! #unity #MAGA 
@DontTreadOnMe *walks on you*

@DraculasCat #NutritionTips  Get sugar from fruit   Use grains in home cooking, dont buy the processed shit.
@DraculasCat Its hard to be scared when you're asleep tbqhf
@DraculasCat The original Egyptian meaning to "be at peace"? I would, if left-leaning politics didn't make me go for a revolver. As for the poorly-aligned Afrocentrism movement? Not a chance. I'm more of a realist, in practical matters.
@DraculasCat You wear a mask for so long, you forget who you were beneath it. 
@drsfingi Yes! I've cut the cord. But I'm streaming OANN from a Russian website until it comes to Sling TV or I'll break down & subscribe after Klowd TV starts up again on Sep 1st. I like OANN so much I leave it on almost all the time now! Almost nothing else is on TV anymore!

@dwighthouse I've never played the new ones, but there isn't much relation between each one. I think the newest ones are completely different in feel to the older ones. I will probably buy a PS4 so I can play the FFVII remake, though. =)
@dwighthouse Thanks! I have some electronics stuff in mind too. Trying to learn as I go. I bought a few Russian IN-2 nixie tubes a few months back, smallest they made. I'm eventually hoping to make a watch, problem is finding the time!
@DwyerDish the reason I've never been NeverTrump is because I had to give him time to stop being a reality show diva and prove he could be president.  He did that in Mexico.
@e   WEW LAD
@e  Sounds good.
@e @a @support A special shout out for the GAB team, we've been beating up this UI in the background and its held up well (believe me when i say many don't do very well this early in the game).   Any minor glitch you may notice is avoiding a potentially HUGE problem later by fixing them fast. 
@e @a NP I expected it was something like that. On this platform, I don't assume I'm b& whenever there's a glitch! 😀 
@e @chris_story http://sli.mg/QQjOcz
@e @gb do you have a matching txt spf record for that specific server?
@e @GB then anything beyond Sender Policy Framework you can set up is DKIM, and not every mailing service supports it 
@e @GB Well, if you have the time see if they'll accept a public key and plunk the path to it in their mail config. 
@e @support Is it alright to flag your post as a test or will that cause an issue on the back end?
@e and also for "less than a minute ago" Android M, default Chrome  https://goo.gl/photos/pkcwVkeKMSTNXbXD7
@e and if you implement some of my suggestions then you will definitely see that number go up. #Ideas4Gab
@e At this point, I just click "forgot my password" and then enter the same one I chose last time around after I get your email link.  That seems to be working so far
@e Awesome.
@e Awesome.  Tested it out and works like a charm.  Was able to refresh and see them maintained as well.  These do nothing beyond tagging it currently, I assume?  No automated system that blocks anyone or anything?
@e Awesome. That was my biggest gripe with the platform.
@e BTW - Add a #fucking #DonateButton!!!!
@e character display issues on a default Ubuntu install.
@e did you see this screen shot? http://sli.mg/QQjOcz
@e Do what you have to do!
@e Does it have a confirm dialog? Is there any way it could get some more separation from the Repost button to avoid accidental #drunkFlagging?
@e Firefox keeps reporting a mixed content error on the pages; I went looking and it seems you might be having a 404 on a URL on the user's home page: https://sli.mg/1LpJZg
@e Found it. On @a's page, he's linked to imgur with a http:// link and Gab's merely linking to the http:// version of the image instead of Gab grabbing it & hosting it when @a's message is shown.
@e Fully understand, site has been working great for me.
@e Here you go.  https://i.sli.mg/hbSTRD.png
@e hey man, not sure if you can DM on Gab yet, but hmu if your team ever needs some help. I'm a dev & ops guy who would love to help out in any way I can. 
@e Hey no probs. To be expected! #BabyGabSteps
@e How does one pronounce your name?
@e I've seen three posts already about people accidentally hitting it. :/ fat fingers maybe. 
@e Is the application decoupled by using a good Service Bus?  This will make a huge difference in performance and user experience.
@e Keep coding you guys will win 🐸 contact Pewdiepie somethings is up Twatter was messing with him...
@e nevermind, I refreshed and unflagging works. 
@e No worries - I realize FREE has "boundaries.."
@e not a fan of how often they use the word "hate" in the rules, which are also incredibly vague. That said, I love the app idea.
@e not stop fun for the phone addicts 
@e Oh I mean you have your instagram profile linked at the bottom of your images
@e Peer review for offenders?  Sounds like a very intriguing idea.  Must be taken lightly though to avoid too much bias...perhaps an opt-in to become a jury member, and then random reviewers being assigned to a case based on how separated they are from the user involved?  Just spitballing.
@e Perfect, thanks. Confirmed (dig @ara.ns.cloudflare.com. mx mg.gab.ai).  I've got another user on the mail server further down in the invite queue, so I'll watch the logs for theirs to come in eventually & how spamassassin responds.
@e release the api! 
@e Seems that gab.ai has MX record, but not mg.gab.ai, which may explain why some aren't receiving invites (or they're going out and mailgun's reporting bounces etc). Suggestion to @a was that if user attempts to sign up w/ same email, offer to re-send invite instead of just saying 'already taken'.
@e Seriously dude, you need a fail whale!
@e Suggestion: • Also have Self Censorship accessible from a person's settings page in addition to their home page?
@e Sure.  It's systems like this that I enjoy designing, so I could probably rattle off a whole slew of concepts.  I'll...refrain from doing so this time, on the off chance I ruin the surprise.  🐸 
@e sweet! Thank you!
@e take a look at the Apache Storm Topology. You can write the bolts and spouts in Scala.
@e THANK YOU BASED GOD
@e That looks much safer! You people at #Gab are fantastic!
@e This is nice! How do I add my instagram to it?
@e Twitter doesn't have an editing feature, so what better way for Gab to one-up them than by providing an edit feature for minor typos! Is that possible to do? #gabchangelog
@e Uh #1 that website is fucking awesome, #2 I'm downloading this right fucking now.
@e we're addicts😇
@e What did he mean by this?!?
@e What does flagging posts do? 
@e What exactly does the "Flag a post" button do?   Also, I clicked it and can't undo by clicking again. There should probably be a confirm modal or something.
@e When you click to flag a post, it doesn't offer a confirmation, cannot be clicked again to toggle it, and doesn't persist on a page refresh.  Bugs, I assume? 😀   Awesome job on the regular improvements to the site though, just wanted to say that.
@e Where do you change your password? I have been looking around the "Settings" page, and on the little gear at the side of my feed, but I don't see it. Am I just blind?
@e Woohooooo that is an awesome fix man!
@e yea i know its nit picky but people will be like wow GAB cant even get its formating right etc.
@e yeah it's gonna be crazy 
@e you are forgiven
@eater sure, I can appreciate your concerns with this; but Gab is all about having a choice; empowering the user with options instead of forcing them down a certain path. We want to offer empheral gabs soon, too. Snapchat proved empherality is a market need. 
@ecu "jury" is a good guess, don't spell the word and ruin the surprise please :)
@ecu added both.
@ecu I agree. These kids are 15 and 16 years old so they're pretty set for worldview at this point.
@ecu More gov would be more incentives to lobby & gain privledgea...oh wait.  Their responsibilities are to their stockholders.  The culture must be hostile to censorship first for it to not be financially feasible to censor.   Market principles work, #Gab is a reflection of this.
@ecu of course not, we're also working on a flow to let community contribute on flagged posts.
@ecu Otherwise known as 'wrongthink' #SpeekFreely
@ecu the socials are getting batshyte crazy with angxiety. I feel an anti snowflake no-cucks trend in the culture arising. Speaking with my Grandson and two of his friends there is hope and according to them they are not alone in their disdain for the Millennials.
@ecu this is the end of the world.
@Eidolon180 Welcome to #Gab, Randall! Sounds like you are one of us! 👍
@ej It wouldn't surprise me that Trump leaked that he might just so he can make them look bad by coming out stronger on his stances.  He's just brilliant.  #TrumpLive
@ejosh1 I have faith in the newer generations cause there's one thing kids are good at. It's not listening to their parents and being spiteful. Could you imagine the family fights in the next 10 or so years when some SJWs will be parents? "GET A JOB DAD!" #OhCarl #GabNation
@ejosh1 I like it for the artwork, special editions, and for having when I dont want to have to connect my computers hard drive to my television.  I understand that many probably prefer digital copies.  
@ejosh1 LOL. I'm just joshing. Part of the character I do at night. I'm taking a break so I'm sensible now. #OhCarl #GabNation #GoodLaugh
@ejosh1 Who is drone?
@ejosh1 You can never tell when it comes to SJWs. When I see certain posts online I have tod ouble take cause I can't tell if they're legit or not. Eventually I find out that they in fact are. Hope Lost. #OhCarl #GabNation
@El_Woodo Can confirm.   She looked like a corpse this afternoon!  http://i.imgur.com/bsCCT9w.jpg
@ElDerecho #SpideyReplies "It's a sort of training we do to learn how to ninja and scare the fuck out of people, strongest survive."
@ElDerecho #SpideyReplies "Nah, the only thing injecting me does is gives me really bad gas and that shit hurts like hell."
@ElDerecho I feel sure that the Hillary donors and staff are terrified at the very thought of her appearing in person on a stage next to a healthy male that can think on his feet!
@ElDerecho Not sure. 
@elena Hi, we have some things in common. I'm a Mom to 2 teenage boys. I am an avid reader & crochet too. (I cross-stitch & sew too). I also use natural oils, like tea tree oil and oil of oregano. Using those to try and get rid of a wart on my son's hand. Welcome to #Gab
@elena Yes, I like oils & a more natural approach to medicine. My son (has autism) and is scared to get his wart taken off by freezing or laser, so we are trying natural methods. I'm ordering Olive Leaf Extract tincture today, read that works sometimes in wart removal.
@Eleven37 The more women we get to handle and own guns the better for them and for America. I taught my girls only one is still interested but the other two are proficient.
@ElGarnero only one? she's going soft on her old age.
@Elizabeth I know the feeling. My body refuses to move. 
@Emily @Shorty  I am haunted by baked goods.
@Emily Afternoon :-)
@Emily I have the worst luck with slot machines. 
@emily I like the Redbubble shirts but what happened to the cost?  Its much more than Cafe Express??
@Emily Teespring, thats what I meant, not Cafe Express heh.  But I don't see where the additional cost is coming from?  How is teespring much more competitive than this?
@emordonez I feel as thought the concept of white privilege is a scapegoat to brush actual issues under the rug. While discussing class it becomes apparent that regardless of race or ethnicity an underprivileged person would have a difficult time getting ahead in life due to a lack of resources.
@EMPERORINTERNET Superfuckinvillain fresh off his massacres in Orlando and Nice #MAGA #MEGA #Trump 
@Eric There was a guy in my office that did the same at times. I consistently gave him shit each time about hating water and how eating dry noodles was an affront to his Japanese heritage. We had some fun times in there 😀
@Ericaaa_92 "stuff I do to high school students" Please, tell us more.
@Ericaaa_92 good evening , hope you enjoy the #GabFam
@ErikDahl   This will help you understand why Texans are so fiercely independent and who will fight with all that is in us to stay free!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n2CUCDATi8 
@ErikDahl Howdy from the great state of Texas!  
@eSan I agree! You either value life on earth or you don't! Simple as that! 
@Escapekey haha.
@Escapekey I hope one day "Stop smoking near me" turns into "Stop eating near me"
@Escapekey I understand why you're attracted, but he's all hat no cattle. SUPER Weak on Immigration, Endorsed FOAM BOY(again, see Super Weak on Immigration), and he ENTIRELY dropped the ball with the Benghazi thing - even let Hillary take the oath IN PRIVATE, not ON CAMERA...Got NOTHING, no Action.
@Escapekey I was all set to see another #Hillary associate found dead.
@Escapekey Super Amazing
@Escapekey what summer? 
@Escapekey — ohhhh ho ho friend, I like that very much 😂 
@Escapekey —because I still have a soul, that's why  It's easy to see the allure of the dark side, though, is t it? A fool and their money are easily parted.....
@etc soooooon 😬 
@eth why is diversity important?  No one ever explains. Genetic diversity and diversity of ideas have a stronger case, but only as a representation of survival of the fittest.  The original meritocracy.
@EvanSus96  Yep Definitely agree 
@EvanSus96 agreed, the argument could go both ways indefinitely - many Christian texts do treat women as property and that does contribute to rape culture and mistreatment of women in general, for example. 
@EvanSus96 Check out my bio field.  I refuse to identify as anything.
@EvanSus96 food for thought, Christianity a couple hundred of years did a LOT of kid killing, murders, raping and pillaging as well.  Now plenty of Christian groups do good humanitarian work across the globe.   We need to end #Radicalism, not the religions themselves. 
@EvanSus96 Gorilla was Trump supporter. 
@EvanSus96 I figured haha 😂😂😂
@EvanSus96 I understand what you're saying, but ppl/the world have changed, moved on. While it's not the absolute authority of obeying the Quaran, it's saying we now live in a world where it's not possible to follow absolutely. Naysayers will say opposite, but personal religious are that: Personal  
@EvanSus96 I'm afraid to look...
@EvanSus96 I'm going to respectfully decline to answer that question.
@EvanSus96 it really is 
@EvanSus96 it's been great #GabFam is the best!!! Best social network community I've ever seen. 
@EvanSus96 Likewise man, really good dialog, only love for ya #SpeakFreely   
@EvanSus96 Never forget Harambe!
@EvanSus96 Not me.  Those are things that I refuse to identify as.
@EvanSus96 That will be up to us. Let's make it happen. 👍
@EvanSus96 That's the thing -- I know ppl who say the same about the Quaran --   Islamic Modernism 
@EvanSus96 this may be wots goin on at youtube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUkj4h_Tq-0
@EXoGEN found you from Twitter 😃 
@EXoGEN no prob! #MAGAfam is going strong right now in AZ
@fadedearth Funny you should mention it, I almost did just that when I originally made the post.
@fall0utX #GabStats <-- Think @a posts them under that hashtag  Here's the most recent one I found http://sli.mg/w1xTof
@fall0utX I would bet that the mainstream media was hoping Trump would choke during the press conference in Mexico, but he came out even stronger.  They're all shaking in their boots.
@fall0utX It's getting pretty #NWO for me
@fall0utX No problem 💃 
@fall0utX Yeah, Idk either, but I'm excited to see Trump slay during the debates!
@FardinElias   Take me in, Oh, Tendie woman!  🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔  #Trump #TrumpLive #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/YAIEoZ
@FardinElias As I mentioned in another reply, the continual screwing over of users will eventually make users jaded.  How long do we keep trusting companies to provide a free speech environment before we just stop joining them, you know?  Is this the end of social media in the works?  Seems likely.
@FardinElias Except what stops another company from claiming free speech, opening a platform on it...and ultimately restricting their users later?  Twitter was opened with the idea that it be a utility of free speech and look at it now.  Something needs to stop this from being allowed.
@FardinElias Honestly, I'm not sure regarding YouTube, I'd say social media in general is responding mostly do third-wave feminism and groups like BLM.  Basically limited content creators to avoid being labeled as supporting racism, discrimination, rape, etc.  My best guess, anyways.
@FardinElias I agree that self-censorship is a great compromise.  However, what honestly stops Gab from pulling the same shit Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have done...a few years down the road (@a, I don't think you will...but I didn't think Google would either).  How do users protect themselves?
@FardinElias I know, which is why the whole idea of using a law to protect free speech within social media platforms still doesn't quite sit well with me...however, I'm not sure how to solve this.  We cannot effectively sue companies for altering their scope, and people depend on these services.
@FardinElias I'm well aware that foreign money is involved for sure.  I'm sure the political scene is probably playing a factor in this all, however, do you think it'll stop when Trump wins (or get worse)?  I guess at the end, I want to know how we stop this from ever happening to #GAB.
@FardinElias k, what can I do to help?
@FardinElias no audition, just join the jam session. Eveyone is welcome  #TheBand  OG
@FardinElias No offense, but this along comes off as sounding a bit tin-foil hat style crazy.  Not that I disagree with the idea, but just saying.
@FardinElias not exceptionally good at it but will try my best👍
@FardinElias So, the death of social media then.  Where instead, we all just essentially have our own small forums for communicating with immediate people we share views with.  Online segregation, if you will.  Kinda see why I say maybe laws should might be needed?
@FardinElias Take care.  I realize we have looped as well.  To be completely honest, I really dislike the idea of dragging law into it.  I guess we either take a chance continually on new platforms, or give up on them in favor of our own isolated communities instead.  Neither is ideal, really.
@FardinElias The timing is definitely there, so you could be right.  However, I'm honestly not sure.  The flagging of controversial videos has been happening for quite some time now...it could also just be them ramping it up.  I won't say you're wrong...it is plausible that it's related to Trump.
@FardinElias you sneaky snek
@fastmammal @teridax
@fastmammal i fucked up 
@fastmammal I WANT MY FOLLOWERS BACK
@fastmammal nice going RETARD 
@fastmammal we need to get carlos on here
@fastmammal yes
@Fedorable am also artist. Will up vote and share. #ArtistsOnGab
@Fedorable awsome and i just got home again to see this!
@Fedorable exactly. 
@Fedorable I can't confirm or deny that yet. There was no response so it may have been automatically generated which is more believable. 
@Fedorable i just looked you up to ask what art your making today and i found this.... sneak preview?
@Fedorable I try to invite them, anyway. Though to be fair, they're probably content with the level of engagement and number of followers they have. But if you know any who want to join for the cause, or for fun, don't hesitate! You never know if you don't give it a shot! 
@Fedorable I wish I have a Cintiq
@Fedorable ill take anything xD.
@Fedorable Like your work how I got  replied to me I don't know Welcome here 
@Fedorable ok tag me in it please when you post it (i am following because yea i like your work)
@Fedorable Precisely like that. 
@Fedorable same here - webcomics are great though, anybody has time to read a well-constructed page two or three times a week :) 
@Fedorable Sugar leads to you wanting to eat in excess of your nutrition, most factually. Simply, sugar makes you excessively hungry. That is why free refills are key to a successful cheap food joint.
@Fedorable the more creative names I see on Gab the more I'm convinced this is a special place.
@Fedorable Too much intake of sugar has been correlated to many diseases aside from diabetes.  
@Fedorable yessir 
@FeeFurz Great minds think alike. Wunderbar!
@FeeFurz I have a thing for music in languages other than english
@FeeFurz I've seen them live once, everybody should.
@FeeFurz Just watch, it's gonna be the same garbage from the "immigration softening" from last week.   The truth is, nobody gives a shit, because the stakes of this election are way higher than anybody imagined in the primaries.
@FeeFurz laibach are seriously germanic and make you want to stomp about.
@FeeFurz look for Laibach, they do The Final Countdown how it should have been done
@FeeFurz Stefan Molyneux too
@FeeFurz The point of #Gab is to be a place where *everybody* can speak freely, regardless of ideology, without being suspended or banned by partisan site-owners. It's not intended to be a "right-wing site" specifically, even if many of its current beta users are right-wing.
@FeeFurz These are strange but exciting times. The West has achieved women's rights, rights for blacks, social programs, etc. so I feel like now they've run out of stuff to fight for, so they're just making everything & anything a huge issue so they have something to fight against and get attention.
@FeeFurz try Gaelic as well https://youtu.be/OZe9N1vNGh0
@FeeFurz Yes I absolutely agree with you! It's all in good fun!  #SocialJustice has a tendency to implement social programs and economic policies that usually result in everyone needing welfare as wages, benefits, businesses, and the quality of individuals collapse. 
@FileNotFound Hi Joe, thank you, you just made my day! The gif is adorable. :) And, yes, I am single. ;)
@FileNotFound I cycle through games, so I'm just getting back into playing it. I really enjoyed it, though. It's exciting finding new planets and stuff. Plus I trust the developers to release free and new content. 
@FileNotFound Kinky...Jelly Donuts??? :) lol
@FileNotFound really tremendous community effort from all ! #GabFamForLife 💚🐸
@FileNotFound yes!
@FileNotFound 😂 😂 
@Fire flagged
@Firebrand I have a BSc in nutrition and about 10 letters after my name to go with it fam.  #NutritionTips
@Firebrand please send actual peer reviewed published research I could cite in an academic journal.   I do not accept nut jobs who jump on the tiniest study of 5 people with poor methodology to provide "proof".
@Firebrand there's not anywhere near enough evidence into intermittent fasting.  If you dont eat for a day then binge on crap processed food its still not healthy. Its the healthy foods that make a diet healthy  #NutritionTips
@Firebrand What variation? I've seen a million ways of doing this...
@FoxAkuma Chocolate and wine!  oh that is raving, not ranting... 
@FoxeoGames ok will do
@FoxeoGames out of 10? I'm only a couple hours into it - loving it so far
@Fr33sp33ch  (using #Gab on a desktop) I tend to Go to the notifications page      Clicking the time of a notification to go to it in another window      Go back to the notification window (50/50 chance I leave the window open)      Rinse and repeat Refresh Notifications page Rinse and repeat 
@Fr33sp33ch  I click the icon labelled "Reply" - I'm pretty sure that is what produces the "expand conversation" button up top. I will say that threading here is definitely unorthodox and more fragmentary. Chalking some of that to #beta and hoping it is improved. 
@Fr33sp33ch  I'm sorry, I was just riffing off of your username, FreeSpeech, and the lack of free speech on Twitter. Sorry if I caused any confusion or feelings of stalky-ness. I assure you, none was intended. As a human being, no, I do not know you from Adam (or Eve)! :)
@Fr33sp33ch I'm actually to young.
@Fr33sp33ch people are starting to miss you on the other site, but pretty soon they can come over here to play and run free with you again!   Fuck shit crap vanilla pudding and edit
@Fr33sp33ch They've got a lot of stuffed planned and coming soon. A way to see if you're already following/followed in a hovertip or similar, some sort of tag auto-completion, etc. #Gab today is in its infancy. #ICantWait to see how good it gets!
@Frank_K Aw look at Hillary, she's doing a peaceful hand gesture too, not LITERALLY HITLER AT ALL! 🙈  https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2015/04/ClintonShruggiegif.gif  #Gab #GabFam #Gabbers #Trump #TrumpLive #MAGA

@FreddyFreecheeze He should insist on an actual debate format. If #Trump refuses and no-shows it would be disastrous.
@FreddyFreecheeze I read that some people were having problems with that using other browsers.  I use Chrome and that is currently what is recommended.  I had no problem.  Just clicked the button under "Settings" and selected my photos and saved. Done.
@FreddyFreecheeze Sadly, #Gab is a bit short on leftists at the moment! Not sure if they're afraid of their opponents #SpeakingFreely or if they will flood in when General Availability Release is reached... 
@FreddyFreecheeze Using your phone?
@FreeAtLast "4000 missed calls"
@FreeAtLast @chris_story and i are trying to break it now before it goes public and yet that would make us complete dicks on the feed and it would flood the crap out of it. @a
@FreeAtLast Ah, a bit off the beaten path from Carlsbad, CA.  Hope you enjoyed it.
@FreeAtLast Bruning man is a culmination of all of America's failures gathered in one place. I say we build a wall around when it happens.

@FreeAtLast How wast the steak?
@FreeAtLast I didn't; where is this store?

@FreeAtLast I'm partial to VMWare-over-RPM builds, and NGinx, MySQL for RDBMS or Couchbase for NoSQL; OO-PHP.
@FreeAtLast It was an honor to serve; thanks. 
@FreeAtLast like greg said
@FreeAtLast Of course!
@FreeAtLast OK, OK... What type of server stack? Audio equipment...?
@FreeAtLast see my previous post and write that script :D
@FreeAtLast So I'm somewhat old-school in that regard.
@FreeAtLast someone else that follows the weasel!
@FreeAtLast the line just got shorter :)
@FreeAtLast We use a while lot of AWS (mainly EC2 and S3 buckets) for development. I have yet been on a project where Those That Write the Checks will pony up for Oracle licenses, so my my experience with it is limited.
@FreeAtLast You know, I might do exactly that. Been looking for another plaything to spin out.
@freespeech   Poor Canada and Australia. They're gonna have to build a wall 
@freespeech  I'm a little south from it so I'm okay  But I've got friends in Tallahassee which I'm worried about 
@freespeech #BestSpeechEver #SpeakFreely
@freespeech A good friend of mine always called them a "wiggly telephone pole"
@freespeech Awwww okay... I'm not sure she likes either at this point
@freespeech Granda Ma's too tired. 
@freespeech He's doing a great job for Trump. 
@freespeech I feel terrible for Bill Clinton.  He won't get any new interns to play with.
@freespeech i hope the trump supporters murder her
@freespeech I will settle for mass deportation
@freespeech I'm an actual vagina and not even #ImWithHillary
@freespeech I'm not watching, my brain is fogged, I'd only say something ridiculous... again
@freespeech Lmfao this is hilarious

@freespeech trump supporters are pedophiles though, they'll probably rape that child
@freespeech Yeah, I'd say that pretty much nails it. #Hillary #Gab #SpeakFreely 
@freespeech You know those numbers don't count unless white people were the ones responsible.  Blacks on Black crime doesn't exist.

@Futhington #NutritionTips  The main benefits from keto seem to be from cutting out the sugar and junk food. It's a bit overly restrictive IMO, just eat proper home cooked food from fresh ingredients 
@Futhington @rose Congrats you two!!! 👑 👑 👑 👑 👑 👑 👑   Good luck on the election and British coup, @Futhington!!  http://cdn2.teen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/british-actors-american-roles.gif

@Futhington I  live in hipster Philly, how do you think I feel?
@Futhington I cried (and still do almost everytime I see it) when he says:  “Bubba was my best good friend. And even I know that ain’t something you can find just around the corner. Bubba was going to be a shrimping boat captain, but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.”
@Futhington I think @a mentioned her, she is a definite #BabesOfGab top contender! 😍
@Futhington I think we have to get a lot of folks on-board to have it trending.
@Futhington I wish I could upvote this a million times. 
@Futhington I'm known by that on other websites so i figured I'd be consistent haha
@Futhington If you and @rose are monarchs, you can get @m to make sweet hot love to me
@Futhington Of course we welcome Cucks here with open arms: we'll just kindly ask a lot of questions 😉 
@Futhington sounds like you like it though. 
@Futhington STILTON  CROPWELL BISHOP  heathen
@Futhington sugar is worth cutting out, bar in actual whole pieces of fruit (fuck smoothies). Processed bread/bread products also are not that great (homemade is fine), biscuits/cakes blahblah It's usually the things high carb things people eat, rather than the carbs themselves tbh
@Futhington That's all I got to say about that.
@Futhington trust me.. @a holds the #PowerOfTheList @rose made the #BigTime 
@Futhington yep she made the #ShortList #OnTop
@Futhington Yep, that's how we roll 😉 
@Futhington yep, we made it.  And Trump isn't even on stage yet! 😀 #TrumpLive
@Futhington YES! Cucks EVERYWHERE!
@Futhington Yes. My culture. I worship the Java God. I think I'm appropriating my own culture T_T

@fys @gabsuppport @e @a
@fys Delicious :D
@fys didn't she say that she still has a dick in one of her videos?
@fys follow 1000 people and just monitor the feed. Otherwise no.
@fys give this a watch, blunt n to the point  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nxB5vxVwT0
@fys Hey!
@fys I do apologize. Trash can be useful! #trashlivesmatter
@fys I had to Google her, to see who she is. She's cute. Sooo, did you, really?
@fys I know you're just dying for me to kiss and tell, aren't you? lol Clue: Be jealous of him. ;)
@fys IMHO, Leslie Jones is a drama queen and a publicity whore. Instead of whining 24/7 about getting bashed (good grief, we all get bashed) she should just IGNORE and block! 
@fys It's really fucked because controversy is where we have questions needing answers, anything else is generally feelgood bs/circlejerk and benefits large music producers more. Rich get richer. Larry Page and his pc agenda strikes again. No wonder they removed "don't be evil"
@fys It's wayyy better than being a corrupt politician! ;)
@fys No socialism can destroy my love for smoking.
@fys Not yet, but once in awhile a kind soul will post them for us mobile users. It's in the works, as is an app.
@fys OMG, I obviously didn't do my research. lol 
@fys Wellll, I dated Dwayne Johnson, when he was famous and...he's all male. ;) 
@g @mm @ppb @nigger #WomenOfGab
@gab how do I go about getting verified, what should I send or list.
@gabsupport so how does one go about getting verified?  Not that I feel important enough to need it but interested in your process. 
@gaming AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!!  I mean - wow, that's a strange business model...
@gaming fck yeah!!
@gaming I don't get the hate for NMS. I personally love it
@gaming I don't keep up on games like I used to but the concept sounds incredibly cool. Too bad it also sounds like it's falling short.
@gaming I guess I'll finally decide if I'm going to get Overwatch
@gaming I think it's beautiful, but not $60 beautiful. And if I understand correctly, the developers haven't delivered on their promise of multiplayer, either. I'll pass until the game is finished and the price is more palatable.
@gaming I'm pretty hyped. I think will go with Pokémon (Glorious Celestia's) Sun version.
@gaming LMAO  I wonder if they will paint anyone that complains as GamerGaters.
@gaming nothing to see here 
@gaming people still play this? 😵 
@gaming That is actually amazing news! Thank you for bringing it to my attention! 😁 
@gaming The game was over hyped by Sony, Sean Murray and gamers. #NoMansSky is fine. Disappointing, but still a good game.  It is for exploration, not for action.  The biggest backlash is the misleading notion of multiplayer. Gamers want to explore together. #Gaming
@gaming This chick is so mentally unstable and mentally retarded it isn't even funny
@gaming this is why I now refuse to preorder new games because of the shit developers pull, releasing a half as game like this
@gaming translation: This game is shit and nobody is going to buy it.
@gb #GabSupportLog 
@gb and #GabChangeLog 
@gb awesome, thanks a lot and will be waiting to hear from you.
@gb okay, MX records are done now. Any more suggestions for us?
@gb thanks for the help! See if you can get @e to ping you back if you know what the issue is still, I sent him your notes from Reddit and I thought we had it patched up. 
@gb yeah, I'll fix that embeeded non-secure posts
@GenericUsername stupid me. thx
@georgecostan45 and then women can suffer even worse from iron deficiency  Stop with the silly diets just eat better food #NutritionTips
@georgecostan45 mmmm yeah look at the data fam
@georgecostan45 we were just trolling my mom hahahahah 🐸😂
@georgecostan45 yeah come to Europe where we prove you can live off ham, bread and red wine and still be healthier than the average American or average vegan
@georgecostan45 yo should I send photos of my BSc and professional membership licences bb? Can also send dissertations in digestive, appetite and scent perception abnormalities in Parkinson's disease, emergency food provision logistics in refugee camps... What else you want fam?  #NutritionTips   
@georgecostan45 you'd think it would be obvious but ham planets are still rolling around in this country. 
@geter and if you look at what happens when the general idiocy try to do it, it's chaos.   A protein shake one day, and a bucket of fried chicken, chips, cakes and biscuits the next is what happens when most people try it. That's not healthier than before at all!
@geter don't know...can't see anything yet...hahaha no seriously...is this to report someone? Hope not!
@geter I mostly read the academic journals fam 
@geter OK -- soi've larned we click the timestamp. Let's highlight that somehow, please? Great product, fast, lovin' it. 😀

@Gingy Close enough for #BritFam, you just need to use the hashtag :)
@Gingy For lubrication reasons or?
@Gingy I feel that way for the Smokies. I miss trees.
@Gingy I'm obsessed with funnel cakes.  That's my go-to when a festival or carnival swings around.
@Gingy patients is a virtue, the only question is are you a  virtuous woman? 
@Gingy so, um I heard there was killing with knitting needles & coffee this morning. Need any help burying bodies? #truefriendship
@Gingy that's like, your opinion man.   http://gfycat.com/LastBrokenHorsefly
@Gingy w/e
@Gingy Well I dunno, maybe the majority would just pass through; maybe it'd actually be good for you? I ain't a nutritionist
@Gingy 😃  I was just saying that my current profile pic is remarkably like my pre-coffee face this morning
@gj I still use Chrome for most of my work tasks.  But, I have Brave open as well for my personal stuff, including Breitbart.
@Globalalpha @Des So far, South Africa has been very much on the ball hey. Our police and intelligence agency, when not aiding government corruption, actually do their jobs with regards to snuffing out potential large scale threats such as terrorism
@Globalalpha @nutbunny Apparently the Jihadi's have moved in since both of us left
@Globalalpha @nutbunny Ha! Ga Rankuwa...haven't heard that word for a long long time! My dad did some engineering jobs there in the 80's too! Hahaha...small world
@Globalalpha @nutbunny I saw that! WTF!! It's insane! So Charlize Theron goes to the US, takes off her clothes, says a few lines and sucks off the producer....and wham bam...American Citizen! No questions asked
@Globalalpha @nutbunny You and me both! The world is getting a little bit smaller every day! Might try for a Green card, if we are lucky. As for SA, I would love to go back, but job opportunity wise, my husband is screwed
@Globalalpha Actually, it's not bad in that sense yet. This terrorism shit is still very much part and parcel of the seedy underbelly of SA, you know the gangsters and criminals. It hasnt raised its ugly head into normal civil society yet as it has in Europe and the middle east.
@Globalalpha ah shit! Totally forgot about those puppies! Hopefully with a little bit of luck this will be sorted soon, just waiting for the surgeon to confirm a date😁 All happening a little fast now tbh
@Globalalpha And brick up the tunnel.
@Globalalpha appologies to all spellingnazis for all My spelling shit, small buttons and big fingers dont work together well
@Globalalpha both received
@Globalalpha but for real what's the policy like in Australia? How's the refugee crisis affecting your country? And does your media suck as much as ours?
@Globalalpha but then you are going to be just like a big squirting pile...every second asshole has one!
@Globalalpha Cute man!
@Globalalpha did you do some auzzi bashing?
@Globalalpha for a second there I thought you were suggesting we were part of the Mo as in Mohammed family...@jesus that was scary😳
@Globalalpha Going from D to B
@Globalalpha good boy!!
@Globalalpha hahaha! No, I tend to give my Merkel a good shagging every now and then! She purrs when I shove that gear into second....totally orgasmic and totally worth every speed fine I get! Bitch performs well under pressure😂

@Globalalpha I can't find it because all of the gab notifications lol
@Globalalpha I don't really mind the heat...it's the bloody humidity that gets me! Just got out from my luxurious bath and now sweating like a pig again! What's the point of putting on makeup to look extra pretty just to have it melt off!
@Globalalpha I don't want that kind of attention 
@Globalalpha I normally help the newby's out by turning them into raging alcoholic's! My gift to them😉
@Globalalpha I posted about it on #FatPeopleStories
@Globalalpha I see you have kissed and made up👍
@Globalalpha I should very well hope you don't have a problem with makeup! #HermantheTranny sounds a little bit iffy
@Globalalpha I'm not one to show my tits on social media lol
@Globalalpha immediately checks to see if it was me kek
@Globalalpha it's all good. You're still one of my faves 😀
@Globalalpha it's going to happen here 😬 we have someone armed outside of our church. Lol I think we will be okay but I have a lot of stocking up on ammo and food to do. This will be a global crisis-if it's not already
@Globalalpha LOL, likely be 40 years senior, but I've still got it. 😘
@Globalalpha MOFam?
@Globalalpha morning! How is your day going so far? Managed to drag your hairy ass out of bed early enough to get a shag from wifey?
@Globalalpha my cats are actually a bunch of wimps...and somewhat racist too....they run and hide when they see a Pakistani, very strange😳 They don't have a problem with people of color but the somehow know what a Pakistani is. Maybe their brothers and sisters were eaten or something 
@Globalalpha my cats would kill the little fucker! Especially my big one! He is huge!!!
@Globalalpha Nah! I like living on the edge! 
@Globalalpha never for a minute thought you were that type! Way too much of a dirty mind to be that stuck-up...and we love you for that😘
@Globalalpha Nice! Let me know your plans. Don't know if I will be her or SA, but let me know regardless. If I am around we can maybe get a drink somewhere!
@Globalalpha nope! Nothing wrong with your Ego, definitely not😂
@Globalalpha not that I am aware of.....maybe we have a secret jihadi on here that doesn't like the fact that I am not in a burka??
@Globalalpha Oliver 😂😂 Very British I say!! My big cat is called Ash (after the robot in Alien) But we tend to call him Lord Ashton as he is so posh! The little one is called Loki (after you know whom) Little shithead pissed on my bed the other day😡
@Globalalpha Phew! Nothing for wifey to hold on but those strong nimble muscles😉
@Globalalpha Roar!!!
@Globalalpha Sad, but some are a bit "sensitive", you know. 
@Globalalpha Thanks! Glad to be here. 
@Globalalpha that's how they do it-come over here, out number us and slowly turn the country Islamic. They average 8 kids per family, the US averages 1.8 and it takes over 2 children per family unit for a culture to even survive. 
@Globalalpha that's one big government check. Our economy is dead.
@Globalalpha Tkz. I already do! ❤😛
@Globalalpha What! No #AlecBaldwinBackHair
@Globalalpha What?? Maybe buy something from Stutgard next...worth every penny! Mine is 10 years and still going strong!
@Globalalpha WTF!! Hahaha! You are going to have to catch me first!!
@Globalalpha Yeah, I am just that type of girl that would be stoned in the public square on the first day😂
@Globalalpha yeah, I saw that! What was that all about?
@Globalalpha yeah, it was only a matter of time before someone got triggered for whatever reason on here....human nature I suppose! No worries, you still have mois😘
@Globalalpha yep😉
@Globalalpha yes, sorry for being a Cuck 😬
@Globalalpha Yip. Luckily hubby is more of an #AssMan so no problems there😂
@Globalalpha you mean a dog, right?
@Globalalpha you should know better than that! Obviously you know I am joking, right?
@Globalalpha 👍
@Globalalpha 😘 Maybe a 🍷 or two.....hahahaha
@Globalalpha 😳😁
@Globalalpha 😳😉
@Globalalpha 😳😳then I am truly fucked!!
@God @Jesus Hey we have cookies, triple bunk beds, and smoothie stands what do you guys have up there?
@God ah! Thanks @God, but you made a slight calculation error...they weigh too much and my frame is taking train! Next time, please make them slightly lighter so as not to break my damn back you masochist!!
@God Thanks fam! At this point you are all the ones making this happen now.

@GOLD Depends on what you're looking for in a waifu
@GOLD Dime a dozen. He's a solid 10 for effort, but he brought a lollipop to a gunfight.

@GOLD I'm too positive for this shit.
@GOLD its at 25% I didn't have a choice it just started. 
@GOLD Nimble is lacking 1) love 2) willpower 3) fabulous.
@GOLD we may someday, but it's not at all on our roadmap right now. Our model will be taking a commission from tips, donations, and subscriptions (which will help you make money Gabbing and spending time here creating content.) 
@GOLD yeah because when you bought shit back then, it worked. They didn't sell shit already broken. 
@GOLD Yeah true, his name is Cuck Manhandler after all and his posts seem like something cucks would say.

@greg   >> because elections should be decided based on sex   Unless they can be decided on race.   Or race _and_ sex!  #ImWithHillary
@greg #badass. You need 10-vote ups for that!!!
@greg Every vaper vapes enough to get the nicotine their body wants, any more and you start feeling sick, they tried to emulate with an ecig what a tobacco cig provides, but yet again they misunderstand the user, and the variables of the ecigs they use.
@greg I take a few draws on my ecig now and again, it's self-titration you only take what you need, I haven't touched mine for probably 20 minutes, and when I do it'll be two or three draws of four or five seconds.
@greg I've been reading it, what it says is that the nicotine in the liquid does the same as the nicotine in the cigarette, it's not the nicotine that kills smokers, it's the smoke.
@greg That's the one I read, the findings aren't exactly the same as the press release, it took for more vaping to reach the levels they aimed for.

@guyWhoInventedFire No, just the most likely to be president. 
@guyWhoInventedFire Of course being corrupt matters. That's why I'm voting for Hillary and not Wannabe-Putin.
@guyWhoInventedFire Oh boy, I love loaded honest questions. Give a specific example of her "corruption", please. 
@guyWhoInventedFire Okay, so you have no specific examples. NEXT!
@guyWhoInventedFire So you admit to voting for Wannabe-Putin? Goddamn you fascists make me sick.

@Haaska upvotes for the moment, Morning and welcome to Gab.
@hackd If you want 3rd party candidates to have a voice, you should push for a preference system like in Australia, where you can put a minor candidate first without "Throwing your vote away". 
@hackd Or, if you reduce the power and reach of the government, money will leave politics.
@hackd so you're talking about political donations which is a separate issue, one I haven't given much thought to
@hackd This is when I think something resembling a parliamentary system would be an improvement.
@hamm #SaySomethingOffensive  Men's rights
@hamm Ah, I see where the confusion came in. No worries.
@hamm Also, I did say that just because I love taking the piss out of Atheists because they are so easy to rile up.
@hamm can you provide details?
@hamm First of all, I never said that you need to be a Christian/ Jew to do what's good for you, it's human nature to do what's in your best interest. But, when you have lazy parents who don't teach their children about morality sufficiently, religion can be a good enough substitute.
@hamm How did the universe come to exist, in your mind? I know there are several different theories out there, but none of them can be proven.
@hamm https://i.sli.mg/7xkuqz.png Well played

@hamm https://media0.giphy.com/media/HTkQXTBHzAjpS/giphy_s.gif
@hamm I disagree. Ideologies can be evil, and people who believe in them can just be misguided. I don't want them dead because I believe in interrogating bad ideas in a free marketplace of ideas, not silencing them.
@hamm I don't think that 95% number is accurate at all. There are plenty of people who came to their own logical conclusion on why they believe in a God. Atheism isn't the only logical belief out there.
@hamm I never said it was proof of any deity existing. I just pointed at it to show you that there are still elements of faith to something that you consider the only logical conclusion. So explain to me why your faith is true while others is false.
@hamm I never said you were pissed off, I just said that was the point of the post. You clearly aren't pissed off because you are having a rational discussion with me. And I don't want to see Marxists and trannies dead. I do, however, believe Socialism is evil and trannies are just mentally ill gays
@hamm I suggest for maximum success you join [redacted]  #JustSpyStuff
@hamm I won't deny that beliefs can be largely shaped by parents, but I don't think that people are incapable of making up their own minds with logical thought processes just because they were raised a certain way.  Just to sate my curiosity, were you raised Atheist or were your parents religious?
@hamm I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body, so no.  I stand in solidarity with my triggered girlie friends.  Or what ev's.  Do these pants make my butt look big?
@hamm I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you mean by this. Could you elaborate?
@hamm If SJWs don't show up, I'm not seeing that as a bad thing.  We'd have plenty of deep conversations without moronic ad hominems being regurgitated every 3 seconds.  Plus we can continue to say what we want & try to 1up each other's shitposts.  Like a training ground for ninja shitposting.
@hamm If they won't even listen to my point of view, it means they are too scared to hear it and I have already won. I don't need to say anything other than that at that point.
@hamm Oh baby 😩😩😩
@hamm Okay, but science still can't explain how exactly the universe came to be. Isn't there an element of faith to Atheism as well, that you still need "one miracle" to explain the universe?  Anyone who doesn't believe in science is stupid. But there are logical people who believe in a higher being
@hamm Sure, and I completely respect your right to criticize any ideology in any way you see fit. But I would like it if you stopped being condescending, like Atheism is the only true school of thought for intelligent people. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent person, do you disagree?
@hamm That's kind of my point. There are times where you need to resist the urge to act in your own self interest for the good of a society. Like, for example, someone else gets that job promotion you want. It's in your self interest to kill them. But there are very few people who actually would.
@hamm That's not truly my outlook on the role of religion in society, I did just say that to piss people off. There are moral people who are Atheist just like there are immoral people who are religious. I think you may be taking me a bit too seriously, but I appreciate the thoughtful discussion.
@hamm The public will vote how they will vote. I don't have any right to say that the way the country votes is wrong just because I disagree with them. If people can believe in someone's ideas even though they refuse to listen to scrutiny, then I guess that's just the way it is.
@hamm There are plenty of people who convert to a faith later on in their lives. But of course children are going to follow along with what their parents do (for example, going to church). That doesn't mean they aren't free to come to their own conclusions later on in life.
@hamm There will be once we go public.  When many others leave Twitter and Facebook, there will be less people for them to harass and their ideology demands they get attention, so they will follow.  Trust me.
@hamm True, but they won't have to leave their mom's basement to sign up for Gab.  And that's another point, many SJWs without Free Speech people to throw shade at will attack each others in-groups and some will leave and join us that way.
@hamm when attempting to mute a user, remember to remove the @ symbol from their name
@hamm When I was younger and I wanted to stop going to church, my parents were completely okay with it. Of course there are asshole parents who force the kids into the religion, but that tends to lead most of those kids towards Atheism. Everyone is free to make their own decisions.
@hamm Which point am I not expanding on exactly?  I haven't muted you at all, and I wasn't thinking of doing it, however if you wish to stop we can stop.  I didn't intend lecture you on the free market of ideas, I kind of assumed we were in agreement there.
@hamm Would you then argue that secularism in the household is the best way to raise a child/ children?
@Harry_Barry Here's what I think will happen. As the debates get closer, the media will find something absurd to be outraged about again. Hillary will then bow out of the debates under the pretense that she doesn't want to give legitimacy to Trump's 'hate speech' by putting him on a national stage. 
@Harry_Barry I don't know, but I think there's at least a good chance it will. The media will work overtime to make Hillary look like she's acting reasonable and presidential by denying Trump a national debate platform.

@hj are... you hitting on him?
@hj because someone might get triggered by it.
@hj brace yourself, the memes are coming.
@hj cheers fam, appreciate it.
@hj funny ... sagittarius' fuck anything...
@hj G'night!
@hj G'night, chief
@hj hi son. I figured you'd want to be known for your haikus most. ;)
@hj I hope you realize I am screwing with you...  😀 
@hj I just upgraded my Chrome to v53 and the emojis are now rendering as they should in terms of color and size. I'll see if there's anything I can do about unicode rendering. Thanks, because without this, I would never have thought to upgrade, and the junk emojis were killing me.
@hj I mentioned this to @a - the native library for Chrome is junk - but I don't know if he can do anything about it. I ran a php-based site once which allowed me to upload my own library. Don't know if that's possible here.
@hj i might watch... (Sick enough for ya)
@hj I would say no. 
@hj I wouldn't be surprised if The Patriots were real.  #MAGA #Trump
@hj if it helps .... I still like the tassels as bookends around your name...
@hj Look, i'm a pro at making a snap judgement based on things I have no knowledge of. Basically with the experience/hours I have doing this I'm an expert in this field.  I'll be the one who makes reactionary statements here, and you both make a cute couple except Callum is def a power bottom.
@hj More sustainable than open pit strip memes
@hj Not sure if that's 𝘮𝘺 problem, seeing as it's how lots of people are seeing 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 profile. But the point is well noted.
@hj Now, every time I see a yellow emoji, I shall say: "His name was Hayden Jones."
@hj ok now I really feel bad

@hj silicone. most vegans with  tits have silicon boobs. want real tits gotta have animal fat.

@hj That's how tired I was, 'cause haiku aren't even supposed to rhyme!
@hj That's just wrong. Duct tape is much easier.
@hj That's true in the theoretical sense, but in practical reality, many company leaders view their employees not as day laborers, but as members of a team. Some even care about their employees' lives far beyond what is relevant to the work. One shouldn't expect this treatment, but it is nice.

@insureblog Oh, by the way, the EEOC and DoJ will ensure that your employer will give your fellow "workers" liberal time off with pay while they are doing the gender transition, just to be fair!
@insureblog Which carrier/state?
@Invictus I can't wait for the inevitable Conservative landslide! Should be glorious.
@Invictus I couldn't agree more. Kew getting suspended for any little thing now. It's disgusting. 
@Invictus I guess smearing your constituents as racists while destroying your country isn't a winning strategy.
@Invictus I usually have no real issues with Kay, I find her to be "less bad" than many others in UK news.  Today she didn't just lower the standard of journalism, but stomped all over it.  Seems Lauren continues to have bad experience after bad experience with British people.
@Invictus It is, and when feminists scream about wanting rights over their own body, they don't see that many fought hard to deny one of those rights.  We see plenty campaigning against porn because they feel women are being exploited, but if successful they would deny women another right.
@Invictus It only serves to infantilise women by saying they can't make a choice over when and where to show their own body. Implying they don't have the mental capacity to make a choice like that, and that they must be protected from their own choices is pathetic
@Invictus It's a sad state of affairs when the likes of Sky news are the best we have to offer.  Shows how poor the rest really are.  Will need to check out her page three views, personally I assumed the models had a right to bare their body if they wanted to. 
@Invictus Page three was a mild curiosity, and yet they deemed it harmful.  I'm often confused when I hear feminists claim they want to "Free the Nipple" and have women walking around topless, like men.  If an image of breasts is harmful, would breasts suddenly become harmless in the flesh?
@Invictus Perhaps it would be an eye opener for her to go live in one of the immigrant ghettos she has created.  Without her body guards of course.  
@Invictus Some BBC content is decent, but there's no way it's worth 145 quid a year. I'll stick to Amazon DVD rentals, YouTube and video games.
@Invictus We all know that sexism only goes one way, that non whites can't be racist and that straight, white, males are the epitome of evil.  It's about time a politician made it mainstream.
@Invictus what other reason is there?

@Isaac Gotta say, not EVERYONE on welfare is lazy shit. MANY have disabilities, lost jobs (cuz their emp cld hire sm1 1/2 their age for 1/4 of the $), suffered career-ending injury, etc.Yes, there is abuse of system, but is VERY small %; is TINY fraction of Fed Budget. #MAGA #Trump #GabFam

@Izoneguy I'm a web services / application developer by day and a comic artist by night :P I was applying for a developer position, so that's a pretty standard IT question lol But I agree! That's why I emphasized that I love Star Trek, even if I was forced to rank Star Wars above it haha
@Izoneguy It's scary honestly. Our government doesn't have to try and silence free speech because companies are doing it on their own. 
@Izoneguy MUH NARRATIVE
@Izoneguy Need more 'common sense' gun laws, and less 'fully semi-automatic clips'  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqJ_4YhYMhE
@Izoneguy Not.  Soon.  Enough.
@Izoneguy Republicans from deep-blue states like New York and California should be bussed into these non-voter ID states on election day. Why not? Voter fraud is clearly what they want, so let's give it to them. 
@Izoneguy robots
@Izoneguy save the rainfo- oh, oh god, bu-but global warming is the biggest thre- and and and deforestat- 
@Izoneguy Such courses neglect to mention that the Communist disease went from basically nothing to controlling huge populations and lands in just over 30 years, causing the deaths of tens of millions of people in the process. 
@Izoneguy This!
@Izoneguy well i guess they can't send facebook to africa right now
@Izoneguy well if they install that massive solar panel system they want in the Sahara Desert not for much longer
@izz because gab is a close community
@izz fuck u
@izz he's a try hard, I hate try hards
@izz I actually agreed with that statement until I really looked at the size difference in the crowds, she's TOAST!
@izz i missed the email 
@izz I'm better than rosy I'm not anime
@izz no one 😂😂😂
@izz thanks izz
@izz upvoted
@izz ur gettin deport -_-
@J_Worfwood It's probably their big push to get people on Red. People will still create videos but regular ads won't work anymore so YouTubers will be told to sell Red subscriptions if they want to be paid.

@JackBurton I killed ALL #Twitter accounts a few days ago - have not looked back.
@JackBurton I should have hashtagged "dong".   #dong
@JackBurton I tried that, I just ended up looking at it in the browser.  I'd like to delete it altogether but most of my friends live in another city.
@JackBurton now you just have to worry about all these #GabFam pervs. We have the best pervs.
@JackBurton Yep.right after this election I am dumping that & Twitter free speech Nazis.Gab should set up a FB alt.as well,they will rule the net,until Berry gives it away.
@jak @e
@jak fuckers about to meet a 9mil round or 20 
@jak So... no physical confirmation that flesh and blood Hillary supporters exist still? 
@JamalOmar debatable
@james   It is like strip club purgatory.  The "third song" never plays and the gal never comes off the stage...
@james @a I do try not to be a PITA. I'm more like a Naan bread- slightly scorched & bubbly.
@james I am in queue for a server for 20-minutes ....  #BestBetaEver  The #LineRide at #disney is better. 
@james yes, hating this. Terrible. Top of bug list. 
@Jargon Mistakes where made.
@Jargon My hope is that when #Gab goes public, it will create a noticeable vacuum that will catch the attention of other social media investors.  If their censorship policies threaten their shareholder earnings, there's a good chance, they will take precautions to hide their censoring activities.
@Jargon quit FB 7 years ago, but make sure to show all of your talent here with the #GabFam and of course with #TheBand  OG
@Jargon Very true.  #Gab has much more to offer.  Even if the other sites reversed course, I think it will be too little too late when Gab starts picking up steam.
@Javajani  profile pictures should be added in a resolution of 200x200 . 
@Jay https://i.sli.mg/HqHdsm.png
@Jay I have learned that it is hard to overlay Gabby over a person's face. They are so differently shaped. #RareGabby  https://i.sli.mg/A4NDez.png
@Jay_again Bisexual, you say?  http://oi66.tinypic.com/28tdzqu.jpg  J/K. Who cares? You be you.
@Jay_again can you provide any details? 
@Jay_again Of Course! Kinda why I didn't tell any real life acquaintances about this place. Don't want to have to worry about any social ramifications.
@JayOf5 five kids?  You are very blessed, I only have one now but would love to have five.
@JayOf5 Hi Jay, I have two adult children and I don't care if God exists or not. Nice to meet you :) 
@JayOf5 I'm certain you'll find nothing but support around here, everyone has been genuine and friendly so far. We're all a just a bunch of misfits right now anyway. Just be you.
@JayOf5 You now what? As Kurt Cobain said "Come as you are". 
@jc   Fun fact: @emily and I met on Tinder.   I wrote about it here: https://medium.com/1000-stories/engineering-serendipity-starts-with-mimicking-real-life-a3176ef422cc#.amedtynz3

@JD Welcome, proud Black man! (And good for you!)   Your future sounds bright no matter what you choose as long as you keep thinking this way. Ever considered combining interests?
@Jer And providing internet to Africans? No one wants the 3rd world getting the opportunity to move up in the global order. Makes Facebook look like they're trying to do good, while not having to actually provide any service to the developing world.
@jerfrog according to @a videos are coming here also but yes a free speech site like this one for videos is needed also
@jerfrog HA HA HA!  Thanks for reminding me about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I'm #Triggered
@jerfrog i while may not agree with what you always say, I will always respect your right to say. Some people don't get its a two way street.
@jerfrog I'll take writer's block over Jar Jar Binks any day.
@jerfrog I've been here a little bit, but not all my favored peoples made the leap yet... So I've been raging on twitter while I waited on the rest of them.
@jerfrog if we weren't crazy, we wouldn't be any fun! #CrazyGabbers
@jerfrog So close
@jerfrog well it was supposed to be offensive to some! 😀 #SaySomethingOffensive
@jerfrog Yay! He's awesome! 
@jerfrog You got tricked by words :D   She used to have a Weiner, not a wiener ;)
@Jesus now I am confused?? 
@Jesus You're breaking your father's rules? Edgy... 
@JesusChrist get in line buddy!!!

@Jew I think the name's Carla Fiorna. You know the guy with the high heels and dresses who was going to be Ted Cruz's Vice President. I guess Republicans are Trans phobic afterall #OhCarl

@jim is a mess
@jim no argument here. Though it's hard to discount his matches with Nak or Okada as well  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
@jim Pete Holmes, Greg Proops, Chelsea Peretti, Dan Harmon (Mostly a writer though) and Steven Crowder
@JL #NutritionTips  Supplements are mostly bullshit - but vit d in winter not a bad idea.   No evidence to benefit of fish oil. 
@JL imaginary attacks will suffice.  
@JL music will be exempt. this is just to kill indy journalism and let them shut up whoever they want as everything breaks everything

@jmerlino ;) 
@jmerlino Smart guy. I like it. 
@jmerlino So you're from Philly I'm guessing?
@jmerlino welcome to #GAB Joe! 👋🇺🇸🐸   #Gab has so much to offer! You'll see a lot of #Gabbers who #SpeakFreely without censorship ;)  @a made a great quick-start video on how to navigate #Gab! Also check out #GabTips! If you have any questions, ask any of your #GabFam! 🐸  http://youtu.be/sxlmq4jktDE
@JoeBiggs Congrats!! Have they declared a fabulous fatwa on you? Ha.  It IS a great friggin shirt.
@JoeBiggs I hadn't seen it before, very humorous take on LGBT! Bound to anger some more sensitive souls who can't take a joke ;)
@joesales  Women receive entirely too much credit for trivial things that men are expected to just deal with.
@joesales Back at ya!! 😎
@joesales Thanks!
@joesales that's the dankest power ranger of them all.
@joesales Yeah!
@JohnB Get NordVPN and pay for it with bitcoins ;)
@JohnB Sounds like you live in Canada. Where only speech sanctioned by Justin Trudeau's guidelines will be legal soon.
@Jones thanks for the tip!
@jones4440 welcome. Enjoy having a voice. #1A
@Jonny  Absolutely, 'freedom of movement' would be better described as EU's FREE-FOR-ALL! #Brexit = EU treaties no longer rule UK Only then can we have complete control over who we let in or deport Else UK will be a magnet for others waiting … http://wisermonkeys.uk/euref/10_EUFutureEnlargement.jpg
@Jonny hahaha and his Welsh😳😱😱
@Jonny he has traded his sheep for camels😂
@JoyfulGrandma Lol that's a good one! So true!
@JS I have no idea what you're talking about. I've never claimed to be a free speech platform. 
@JS I'm not arguing that it's any platform's legal right to do whatever it wants with its platform, especially if it's outlined in the TOS, I'm just saying that I expected Gab's TOS to be more user-centric I guess?
@JS Probably. I'm not 100% on what legal jargon means what.
@JS Really all I was saying is "without notification" is a little shitty. Even if it's "hey, your account was terminated because you sent death threats." Get in the habit now, so the userbase can hold them to that standard later.
@Jstfire #DicksOutForHarambe http://i.imgur.com/eGOpQ69.jpg
@Jstfire #HillaryNoShowInShowInMexico In-fucking-deed!
@Jstfire Also it's all love from here and no hard feelings. I'm actually very much enjoying the dialogue. 
@Jstfire An argument can be made that Islam as an ideology is bad. Plus, Christianity clearly doesn't teach that you can rape. They didn't get their rape or kid killing as a source of the religion. If they did they REALLY twisted it. Plus, Islam was established in violence from a warlord. 
@Jstfire and showing the conversation when you click on a reply, so many little things to improve
@Jstfire But do you not completely illegitimate your entire religion by saying "It's 2016 so now we can't follow this." I'm a Christian, it's 2016, and homosexuality is still a sin. My religion can also fit into 2016 bc it calls to love the homosexual and just hate the act. 
@Jstfire Get your out-selves out here, #GabQueers! That's an order. 
@Jstfire I don't believe that is the most popular belief of the world. It is mostly a 600 A.D. religion in 2016 which just can't fit. There's a reason it oppresses people all over the world. Islam modernism is incorrect bc Quaran isn't interpreted but obeyed. 
@Jstfire I read that as 'potions'.  I must read too much Harry Potter shit.
@Jstfire I was never even on twitter, and I am a happier man for it. 
@Jstfire it makes me wish I HAVE cash
@Jstfire just people testing free speech, use it or lose it, now call me a faggot and add some flair to it!! <3
@Jstfire the problem is the fatties take big boned portions
@Jstfire The Quaran is a literal command book that can't be argued with. You do exactly what it says. The Bible is a historical book that must be read and interpreted in context. Simply reading it and deciding what it means isn't enough. The Quaran is blatantly for the mistreatment of women. 
@Jstfire there is a lot of improvements to be made, but It looks good
@Jstfire Things such as talking in church or keeping your head covered while praying or whatever is simply contextual that had purpose. There is a reason we don't follow that today because we aren't in a 2,000 year old context. 
@Jstfire This was reposted by @shorty. You have been given the blessing of the Goddess. 
@jstfire wants to make #GabQueers a thing. So, let's make it a thing.   @Callum @Tristan @bro @brittney @Ace_Uncensored @hj @Superman @shorty @w8 @sethferree @michellejoz @qq @Roberto @DeltaWhiskeyTemplar @rose @OG @Don @TH @king @HenryTudor @caro

@Kansokusha http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/855/171/5c5.jpg
@Kansokusha It actually is. Google Italy + vegan restrictions on children (or something to that effect). They'll make it illegal to force kids to be vegan. Humans were meant to be omnivores, meat is a normal part of the human diet throughout history.
@Kdamageinc While that is true technically what I said is right. He did write Mechanix and took not only the lyrics but the sound when recording for Megadeth.
@Kdamageinc 🤘🤘🤘
@kellymarie So that's why Jesus hates gays
@killary_Clinton Again?!
@killary_Clinton Ah no worries I got Medicaid birth control.
@killary_Clinton but I still love a troll 🙋🏼
@killary_Clinton clearly. but i measured twice, and the shoe fit. 
@killary_Clinton don't care. you're the one spending the time and energy to do it, so CLEARLY it means something to you. #logic
@killary_Clinton durhur idk the difference between udders and tits durhur
@killary_Clinton eeeuw! #ThatsGross
@killary_Clinton hardly. did because i was bored. then i wasn't. unlike the 100+ you did. no triggering, because the verdict on you is already in. clearly.
@killary_Clinton Haven't tried that yet. I guess you can teach an old bitch new tricks.
@killary_Clinton https://i.sli.mg/A6XF81.jpg Now go jack off to that. Before my husband blows you the fuck up with his legal firearms. 😄 report me? Nah..can't do it. Stay away from my girls.
@killary_Clinton I always found the stairs to be a cleaner method.
@killary_Clinton I'm already happily married, and probably way too old for you. But I can offer you friendship. Somehow I get the feeling that you don't have many friends. 
@killary_Clinton If you had any semblance of a life, you wouldn't have to ask strange women on the internet for nudes. Real men go out into the world and date! I bet you've never had a date in your whole life. That's a big part of your problem. You are bitter and lonely.
@killary_Clinton like i care. you're so negative you make chronic depression sufferers seem joyful. 
@killary_Clinton lmao  ( • ) ( • )
@killary_Clinton Not sure I can walk that far though, my back gets to aching.
@killary_Clinton Oh god and on that note bedtime for me. Top bants. Have fun! <3
@killary_Clinton Oh yea baby cankles for days here. 
@killary_Clinton Sharing this type of content on your own feed as a form of expression is one thing, but targeting other users and trends with intent and malice is another. It's immature and asinine.  Users: please visit our desktop app to mute users and words or trends you do not want to see. 
@killary_Clinton Sweet, your trailer or mine?
@killary_Clinton that's your profile pic.
@killary_Clinton those i like. you, not so much.
@killary_Clinton Too many times to count. ;)
@killary_Clinton Well hell I can handle that, I'll bring the Ajax you bring the flour?
@killary_Clinton Yea that last fisting was a bit much sadly.
@killary_Clinton Yea, the bruises help to cover the trackmarks too.
@killary_Clinton Yeah, because that scenario is so "true to life". It's not. Get off the internet and go outside. Live a real life. Seriously.
@killary_Clinton You are just bitter and jealous that you don't have enough money to invest in @a and with #Gab I really do feel sorry for you. It is apparent you are an unhappy & lonely person. 
@killary_Clinton you know what makes a liar a liar? it's the lying. a jerk is a jerk by 'its' actions. definitions matter.
@killary_Clinton you wanna see tits?
@KillBox also most trade schools the students will have a job lined up before the end of their junior year. 
@KillBox But the uneducated don't know why #Trump is right about what he says
@KillBox But when everyone is telling everyone Trump is racist, I just don't see him winning right now
@KillBox calling #GabFam and #VeteransOfGab need our best and brightest, got a problem that needs solving here.
@KillBox Hmm, you got me. Let us just pray it never happens.
@KillBox http://www.mtu.edu/safeplace/ I think you meant Michigan tech right?
@KillBox I just don't see that as big enough yet to allow him to win. 
@KillBox men are men and women are women?! what is this madness!!!
@KillBox Well we'll see come election day, but I don't think the rage against the establishment is high enough yet.
@KillBox yea people call mtu northern tech, MIT etc it's gets confused all the time. But it's still a good school
@KillBox Yes, but I don't think nationally America is ready for him, like I said, I give it 4-8 years.
@King "I'd like to thank the University..." 
@King "Isn't it awful how doing something illegal is a crime?"
@King A lot of us do.
@King ban assault trucks, assault knives, assault box cutters, assault laptops, assault cell phones, assault suitcases, assault machetes, assault stones, lmao
@King can't access it from mobile mate, I've been waiting to try and censor myself for days 
@King Congrats mate! 😉 
@King downvoted out of respect.   You're welcome.
@King fucken gottem
@King go ahead, get angry.  Express your anger by posting a gif.  Go ahead and tag me, see if I care.  See if I'll repost it, upvote it and then suck your dick.  See if I care...
@King http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/093/533/dfd.png
@King https://i.sli.mg/vVlZ77.jpg
@king I can't breathe😂😂😂😂😂😂
@King I still cringe at that.
@King I was fucking muttering this as I drove into Downtown Burlington, Vermont today for an appointment---pretty sure I was thinking it on the drive out too.
@King I'm actually going to die
@King I'm gay
@King if we were to just ban "assault language" it would solve the world's issues. 
@King It's called a power button
@King It's entirely possible many illegal immigrants will leave on their own to avoid being deported. They know they're illegal. Either way, they have to go back. 
@king likes attention, kinda like my fake son @callum, who has a dirty mouth. @hj is the #haiku master. @StarWars is well #StarWars. @Des is always witty and in you face with sass in the nicest of ways. @DeltaWhiskeyTemplar has a great beard.  
@King lmfao I'm so glad I'm not on it
@King nah..
@King not available yet. 
@King Not sure why it's hard to understand.  Legal immigration status is pretty easily and quickly checked. It's not illegal to inquire about someone's status. If they're illegal, then they're transported to the border and told to GTFO.. 
@King oh god
@King oh my god the girl replied to me saying "no immegrant should be illegal" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@King Ow, my pride.
@King probably a reference to some kind of self deportation. Make welfare and outbox school access require IDs and immigration papers, if they don't already.
@King probably not but isn't that free speech aswell?
@King Right on! #FuckCommunism
@King SBG is awesome.  Also love That_Guy_T (a fellow Capitalist and Libertarian like myself).
@King Sorry...That has been changed to: If you say something which hurts my very precious feelings, we will break your bones, you worthless  Piece of Crap.
@King thanks for 100 upvotes on a pretty basic post lol
@King That's what I was looking for
@King this may be my most clever of like farms I have ever made. It better make me famous 😡😡
@King Who doesn't? 
@King who the fuck keeps downvoting this? 😡
@King yes, I like his stuff. Wonder if he`ll ever join us here in gabland
@King You too? I was drawn in in the 60's. when I realized what a bunch of lying conniving,weasels and murderers they were i didn't just disassociate I crusaded for until the wall went down. I despise them for taking advantage of my Youthful idealism and naivete.much like today's lefties do to kids.
@king... Don't make him grow stronger...every time you say his name..he GROWS...https://i.sli.mg/Tdf5fY.jpg
@KingPeanutMan Aren't you the universe itself? ;)
@kk Hello back
@KokainCupcake about time babe! Let's see that dick. Gab is private for now.
@kosto it is nothing like twitter still (since it is on the personal level as apposed to blocking it for everyone.)
@kramsolo #Dizzlekkzikleavesmatta
@kramsolo #NailedIt
@kramsolo *Britons ;)
@kramsolo >_<  Never mind!
@kramsolo booooo 😔
@kramsolo Clown:  a comic entertainer, especially one in a circus, wearing a traditional costume and exaggerated make-up.  Shit: noun     1.  faeces. an act of defecating.     2. a contemptible or worthless person.  so a person wearing makeup who is worthless...  𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿.
@kramsolo Don't investigate further then. It's an SJW circle jerk site.  And Supernatural.
@kramsolo exactly they must have a crap life, and I had to ask people to stop upvoting me, too emotional by then. yeah..
@kramsolo I agree.
@kramsolo I apologise for my microaggression. Please fuck my wife as reparation.
@kramsolo I meant the show. Tumblr is 70% SJW, 28% Supernatural fandom and the remaining 2% is everything else.
@kramsolo I see your point and while I partly agree with it, I can't fully agree with it, as I tend to view self-expression/how you dress as your own right. Of course, there should be exceptions made where you MUST remove your Burka, but I don't agree that it should be outright banned.
@kramsolo I think if we want to prevent terror attacks from occurring in the UK - and they will continue to occur - we have to address it in a different fashion. One method, for instance, is careful vetting and increased security on the borders from people seeking to come here from high risk nations
@kramsolo I think that is entirely true in nations like the Middle East. However, I think the amount of women forced to wear a burka in first world nations, by their husbands or family, is significantly lower - though I won't deny it does happen. But yes, Islam has always been a political force -
@kramsolo ill-influenced, I'm willing to bite the bullet. 
@kramsolo it will says someone is liking your posts, they are hitting the button multiple times and it shows as a like when it's a dislike
@kramsolo It's addictive. Before long you will be visited by the curse of the #Trigglypuff and then it's non-stop Tumblr for you!
@kramsolo it's been two years now since I changed to this eating pattern, and I'm not bothered by it.
@kramsolo Morning all. #BritFam
@kramsolo Somehow I doubt they will, and they are welcome to that life.
@kramsolo somehow it always ties back to flat earthers.  Those assholes.
@kramsolo someone downvoted your imaginary points, I upvoted it because i'm not a shitclown. I wanted to make you paranoidly aware
@kramsolo Thanks for the friendly tip - I'll keep that in mind.
@kramsolo That and our overseeing of mosques, which have been known to be a buzzing hive for extreme radicals/producing these sorts of zealot jihadists is piss poor. While it irritates me that the government has to step in, if it reduces the risk of a terror attack and young minds being (cont)
@kramsolo That is an issue, yes. Though modern day conquering is establishing ghettos, the likes of which we, Belgium and France have seen where there is no integration, no cooperation, and they all consist of one group of people/ethnicity. 
@kramsolo Those liberal types are always talking about common sense---I don't want to catch or develop it---gonna give this a try. 
@kramsolo throughout history seeking to conquer (look at Europe with Hungary and the Ottomans, for example) so I can get the fear, then and now. 
@kramsolo yep about 1500 in total, I was too dumb to work out what was happening and mute them
@kramsolo Yep hard to see anything other than that ass.  Complaining? Nope!
@kramsolo yes, @a specifically posted your handle and Said "BEHOLD I AM BECOME SHIVA, DESTROYER OF @KRAMSOLO" we were scared bro, we would've said something... but we are all cowards at heart. sorry.
@krissy Don't say anything you feel uncomfortable saying about yourself, don't force it either, just take your time and let it flow.
@krissy Glad to see that you're fine.
@krissy good to see you back on  #TheBand  OG
@krissy I'm an introvert, I think the same, then I get caught up in things and post stupid stuff, hate myself for a while and then get back on the damn keyboard and type some more.
@krissy I've managed 2300 posts in less than a fortnight...
@krissy Keep going!
@krissy Oh, trust me you're not alone in that, I have spent hours staring at a wall going over things I said as a kid, and I still feel like crap for it. But you get past that and you think something is funny, you postr it and other people join in laughing. Then you feel good. :-)
@Kurt  Oh damn  I watched it on C-SPAN   But that's awesome to hear  #TrumpLive
@Kurt Agreed. And plenty of speeches/rallies left to transcribe live. That's awesome of you to do for those who don't get to watch. Again,  great work. 
@Kurt don't follow....  LEAD!
@Kurt is that some kind of racial slur!?!  Like his plane does lot have plastic covers in the furniture or something?!??  (Sarcasm)
@Kurt Jesus Christ, are you on adderall?
@Kurt New York accents have their advantages on national tv
@Kurt parachutes and trebuchets....
@Kurt piñata!!!!
@Kurt seamless  Good quality 👌
@Kurt This is a great idea!
@Kurt this is a sexist policy because women don't have skills
@Kurt You killed it, thanks for doing that. 
@kys TRIGGERED: https://i.sli.mg/16At29.png #SaySomethingOffensive #GabFam #MAGA #Gab #SpeakFreely #Trump #NutritionTips #introduceMyself #Hilary #gabchangelog
@LaFemmeMacabre "there are cultures that worship coffee"  Jesus Christ How Horrifying.
@LaFemmeMacabre :-)
@LaFemmeMacabre Agreed.  Banning is a dumb idea.  
@LaFemmeMacabre Also, I have noted in the past 4 years how more and more woman are becoming fully covered. This means that Islam is becoming less tolerant. Countries that used to have very few covered woman, are now flooded with them, and it is spreading. This is NOT a good sign
@LaFemmeMacabre because you're an entitled millenial... :-)
@LaFemmeMacabre But some things our gender does specifically define things we will be better at.  Men are generally stronger.  Women generally have higher pain tolerances.  
@LaFemmeMacabre But this is exactly what they want! We cannot give into them...next, they will have us wearing Burka's
@LaFemmeMacabre Funny thing is in South Africa we have no Arabs except a small amount of Lebanese...and they are mostly Christian. From what I understand, the Pakistani's hate the Arabs, so why adopt Arab culture? i don't know, personally I think Islam as a religion, is losing the plot completely
@LaFemmeMacabre Good Morning From the UK, they don't have a position for me yet.  https://i.sli.mg/FgAq8i.jpg
@LaFemmeMacabre I agree! Small steps. I just do not want them (especially the men) to think that this is the norm for all of us. Islam is very demanding, and the more we give, the more they will demand. There has to be a line that won't be crossed.
@LaFemmeMacabre I detest having my photo taken, even more when I take it myself, I'm only a bit grumpy most of the time 😎
@LaFemmeMacabre I don't think saying men are strong implies me thinking all women are weak.  There are tons of women that are easily stronger than me.
@LaFemmeMacabre I gave up after the first time, we let the Saudi's get away with all sorts.
@LaFemmeMacabre I like what you have done here.
@LaFemmeMacabre I look grumpy?  That's one of my biggest smiles 😉 
@LaFemmeMacabre I understand your disgust, but it was my fecking government that backed them for that position.
@LaFemmeMacabre I'd prefer to break all the rules, and let everyone be equal to each other.
@LaFemmeMacabre I'm sure the hot air from those people could be used as well
@LaFemmeMacabre I'm sure you are 😛
@LaFemmeMacabre In South Africa, where I am from, we have have Muslims for hundreds of years. The woman were dressed in western clothing, some with headscarves. In the past 4 years lots of them are now in Burka's. There are no newcomers from other cultures. In SA its purely religion driven
@LaFemmeMacabre It sucks to be a introvert. One would think the Internet would make it easier for me.  Nope.  Still have a hard time talking to people.
@LaFemmeMacabre lol my step fathers father was actually a plantation owner in malay before WW2
@LaFemmeMacabre malaysian even
@LaFemmeMacabre No problem 😃 I see it from another perspective. I agree it is not fair to tell a woman what to wear, but the main problem is the ideology of Islam hiding behind the clothes. Most of these woman are forced to wear it by their fathers, brothers and husbands. 
@LaFemmeMacabre No, it's a trade item.
@LaFemmeMacabre Not sure where you are from so I have no comment there.    I think both send the wrong message.  The Ban Bossy was basically saying that women are so weak that calling them a name as a child will completely alter their life goals.  I think it is highly disrespectful to women.
@LaFemmeMacabre nothing wrong with being left of center!  You're welcome here and we won't censor you!
@LaFemmeMacabre Ok.  Sounds like a plan.  I do have a question for you.  Your bio says you are a feminist.  Remember those "Ban Bossy" and "Throw like a girl" campaigns?  I got yelled at by a friend for saying i think those were unneeded and kinda dumb.    What are your thoughts?
@LaFemmeMacabre Okay that has given me my first real laugh today, so thank you for that :-)
@LaFemmeMacabre Pretty picture. You have a nice smile in addition to a seemingly wicked sense of humor. #Gab does need more voices from the Liberal/Left to get some balance in the community before throwing the gates wide open to the masses. (Full Disclosure: I'm an adamant #Trump supporter :) ) 
@LaFemmeMacabre See typical millenial stereotyping me, I may well be a hairy white colonial, but I'll stick to my coffee and nicotine liquid, no tea and opium here young lady...
@LaFemmeMacabre So what exciting things do you have to look forward to today other than verbally assaulting your ex-imperial overlords? :)
@LaFemmeMacabre Sometimes you just have to accept things, and I'm not an easy person to put up with if I'm honest.
@LaFemmeMacabre That used to be me, it was called chuntering, and I could do it for hours if we were doing a long march with full kit.
@LaFemmeMacabre The UN was a good concept but as any organization, once you start taking in groups with opposite ideologies and put them in positions of power, the organization be becomes a worthless joke with groups vetoing each other. The UN is such a toothless, lost organization. #SpeakFreely 
@LaFemmeMacabre then sleep well and sweet dreams.
@LaFemmeMacabre To late, I did, and now I'll go back to being a white oppressor appropriating your culture and trade goods :-)
@LaFemmeMacabre well we could gab about life being terrible, but it's not going to get us anywhere, all we can do is try to make the best of it.
@LaFemmeMacabre wow have you been practising that SJW rant all day just to catch me out :-)
@LaFemmeMacabre Yea and I only use strength as pure lifting ability.  Mental strength and things like that are totally different.
@LaFemmeMacabre Yeah but men will always be able to be stronger.  The strongest woman in the world will always be out done by the strongest man.    There are some things that our biology will dictate.  So I don't think that can be considered wrong to say.
@LaFemmeMacabre Yep and I feel absolutely no guilt about that at all :-p
@LaFemmeMacabre you can have one back Natasha <3
@LaFemmeMacabre you just love saying that to one of the old time colonial masters 😉  don't you?
@LaFemmeMacabre You're appropriating the appropriate appropriation appropriately, so it's all good.
@LaFemmeMacabre You're maylaysian yes?
@Laroquod I finished Loom in like six hours.. Which is one of the reasons I didn't enjoy it.  The other SCUMM games took me weeks and weeks. 
@Laroquod I remember playing Zork on C64 and was constantly trying to guess what to do.. Open Door... Turn on Flashlight...etc.
@Laroquod True. My favorite games of all time were probably the SCUMM games like "Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders" and "Maniac Mansion".  But then they switched to some new interface with "Loom" and I found it much too directed and on rails. 
@Laroquod Yes hopefully eventually #Gab can make a personalized recommendation system for who to follow.  We are working on one at the company I work at and it's a fascinating subject.  
@Laroquod you are a poet!
@LarryLSharp Freaking sick.
@LarryLSharp Hah! Sometimes I wish I lived in Texas, but I'm in Central Washington. It's high desert here, and right in the heart of Washington's rattlesnake habitat. Quite different than rainy Seattle.
@LarryLSharp He should really consider adopting a puppy before Child Protective Services throws his scrawny ass in jail
@LarryLSharp I think we're still 3-4 beverages from hopped up mode. But I'll run straight down there when I reach it. When you hear the sonic boom, its done. ;)
@LarryLSharp I'm definitely skeptical, it may explain his apparent detachment from the child if it's not actually his.
@LarryLSharp Just love kitties! Have two fluff balls and they are just awesome! Ragdols are gorgeous 😍
@LarryLSharp My Ragdoll approves of my inclusion of the beasts who are throw away critters.  They too need protection.  
@LarryLSharp the cat looks like it's wearing your hat. #CatInHat
@LarryLSharp The fact that Anthony Wiener procreated and has any women interested in him is shocking.  
@LarryLSharp We don't have roaches in Washington. 
@LarryLSharp Why no criticism of women? If women were using kids to lure men, we would assume the men would be perverts.  So any woman who is enticed by a child must surely be twisted, perverted and wrong in the head.
@LaurenSouthern kills it on Sky News today. #GabFam #SpeakFreely  "I don't know legal immigration even exists anymore. I can just put on bronzer, get on a dingy boat and show up on the border of Sicily with a Quran in hand and be accepted as an immigrant"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r4_OJF-ARA
@LaurenSouthern When all this kicked off, Merkels genocide I mean... I basically said what you said at work and people pissed themselves.  I think I said I should get some fake tan and get a free holiday on the greek islands.  Someone even piped up with boot polish.  Don't worry your knackers lass! 
@LaurGarTX welcome thank you for being here!
@LaurGarTX welcome,  Lets dance. If you don't dance, Make us laugh.
@LawyersPlayDota Do you look at con law?  I'm trying to wrap my head around the Heller dissent.  Is the position that the 2nd amendment only lets people have guns when the government decides people can have guns anyway?  As in, part of a government sanctioned militia.  Am I being unfair?
@LawyersPlayDota Ignoring the right to self-defense, I think the militia right isn't just a right to be in a government-sanctioned militia.  A constitutional right cannot be killed by mere legislation, and his view says congress decides if the militia exists and with it the only right in the 2nd.
@LawyersPlayDota the Internet is good for many things but some days it feels like memes are what make it special.
@LazyBrainGames "claims it's removed"? check his fucking twitter account for a checkmark you piece of shit chairplastered retards.
@LegendStatus   MSM are just puppets controlled by those in power. Their goal is to keep us uninformed of true matters at stake  #MSMfail  
@LegendStatus  What in the actual fuck?  
@LegendStatus "It's not a de-BATE, it's a FO-rum, silly! Completely impartial." #RiggedSystem #Trump #MAGA
@LegendStatus & don't forget that Matt was all up in the Clinton Foundation...smh Ridiculous! Who does a debate by video conference! Hitlery is out of control!!! She is so scared of Trump, He will destroy her in the debates! I can't wait!
@LegendStatus , get your hot sauce ready mi abuella! It's tendie time from Hillary's official Facebook page!  🐔🐔  #Trump #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/BDBNyf
@LegendStatus 15 days in. We're doing great! #FrogArmy
@LegendStatus chew some cloves, the essential oil, eugenol, is a strong dental amelioratant.
@LegendStatus Give us time, I have faith we can degenerate pretty quickly given 300 characters at a time!
@LegendStatus Good to hear, I think people are a little focussed on Mr. Trump right now
@LegendStatus Here's the "Veteran's Group" that will be hosting this. http://iava.org/stand-with-veterans/ What's the first thing you see on that page? "Demand that Trump apologize immediately to all veterans everywhere" Part of O's "new military"
@LegendStatus Hillary is clearly afraid that Trump will bite her... Or incinerate her with his visage?
@LegendStatus I actually think this isn't too shabby a choice for an early discussion. If you separate candidates, they can't interrupt each other and hopefully we'll get to hear more about their ideas than would be possible in a traditional election debate. 
@LegendStatus I feel like there needs to be a #RealGabbersOfGab #GabTag for those that drink real drinks. 
@LegendStatus I think it's her health- there are clips where it looks like she is overloaded with stimuli, and this looks designed to prevent that.
@LegendStatus isn't a toothache by definition also a headache?
@LegendStatus Now we're talkin'! 
@LegendStatus So basically this is saying Hillary can't handle being on stage with Trump at the same time. Because we all know Donald has no problem with that.  
@LegendStatus technically not a debate, its a opportunity for them to answer questions fielded by a panel, that just so happens to be moderated by a clinton supporter, so no bias there.
@LegendStatus Thanks for posting. In case anyone wants to know more about IAVA (which is briefly mentioned in the article as the host) they have a great website and a wonderful program. They have many get-togethers for vets and do a ton of community outreach. I can post the link if there's interest.
@LegendStatus They want to be sure Donald can't invade her "personal space", and they can easily cut away from Hillary in the event of a problematic event (coughing fit, spasm, etc,).
@LegendStatus They're not calling it a debate, its a "forum".  I think it's to give Hillary practice against Donald, without having to actually debate him.  And to help her team formulate responses to him for the actual debates.  Hopefully she'll stroke out before then. #DidIJustSayThat
@LegendStatus This "forum" was designed for hitlary.  [x] Sitting, not standing. [x] Ran by Clinton Crony [x] Doesn't have to debate directly against Trump Audience plants? Does a pickle jar pop when you open it? [x] Hillary sympathetic plants in audience.
@LegendStatus This isn't the presidential debate, it's a Q&A with members of the armed forces.
@LegendStatus Trump should refuse. 
@LegendStatus Trust me, I definitely can't wait to see #Trump's high energy crash into #Hillary's dishonesty too. It will be glorious! I just hope she'll still at least be able to sit in a chair when debate time rolls around. No one likes trying to debate no-shows.
@LegendStatus welcome to gab, if you look at the 'popular' link at the top it'll give you some names to follow, jump into the conversation and if you feel like it, post an #IntroduceYourself gab #SpeakFreely
@Leon #AusFam over here
@Leon #NutritionTips if it sounds a bit far out and weird it probably is! Bulletproof coffee is absolutely bonkers, don't do it you nut jobs. Same for coconut butter. Just eat actual green vegetables, all vegetables, fruits, legumes, etc. cook them yourself, screw these dumb powders and supplements
@Leon #NutritionTips prunes have lots of fibre which is why they make you poop.
@leon best avatar I have seen yet on #Gab.
@Leon bs, you should eat your body weight in food prior to sleeping, if the food intake is high, the body burns it like a powerboost in starfox letting you fly to recovery faster and get extra points.
@Leon but do you take one dip and end it?
@Leon depends on the person lol it varies for all sorts of reasons we dont know 
@Leon fucken oath
@Leon God punishes those he loves, I'll refer you to Job.
@Leon how the fuck is Southwold, in Suffolk, ooop norf? Midlands I'll grant you fam
@Leon I was in Devon at the weekend, all the old farmers are like "Fuck Hillary, go Trump"  It's great
@Leon I'd say more "she'll be right" but yeh
@Leon I'm really enjoying the space :)
@Leon many are, but have seen many left-wing biased news articles or those from sites that tend to attract more astute readers where the comments were pretty awesome.
@Leon thank you!
@Leon Your parents are literally terrorists, use their main PC and search for "How to build a vestbomb" "Why is vestbombing the only way to show people how great Allah is?" & "If I want to show people how peaceful Islam is, is bombing the only way?" then call homeland security. the rest is karma <3

@Libertarian german #coffee? strange I get this stuff at home & when Italians come they say it's one of the best coffees they've had in Londonistan.  http://www.lavazza.co.uk/uk/at-home/blends/qualita-rossa.html
@Libertarian I wonder what the response rate is for the invites that are sent out. I also wonder how long the waiting line is from the front page now. Is there a status page for that? #Gab #Gabfam
@Libertarian if any of the locals ate bacon...
@Libertarian if the term "basic bitch" had an avatar, it would be this crummy drawing of Ayn Rand they used for the article. 
@Libertarian oh there's a big big big difference in the UK between London bacon and sausages, and Lincolnshire bacon and sausages...  
@Libertarian That's awesome!
@LimbRepair today was incredible
@LinesTypesLines @a is also passionate about philosophy. I bet there are some good discussions in your future! #KnowThyself 
@Lirakitty Ah, so I actually used the improper derivative of "shawty".  I said "shorty".  My geek disconnect is showing.
@Lirakitty because I started to write supernatural (really) and you have infested me with a keylogger. Cheater, but yeah, I dunno where it should've ended. probs 3/4 haven't watched since Leviathan
@Lirakitty Coffee to stay sane, music to stay sane, company to be sane with  Beautiful day!
@LiraKitty Did you know you're on the Who To Follow list? Good going, newbie! XD
@Lirakitty Good because Universe is like showing someone Firefly and then telling at the end of the season "By the way they cancelled, here let me take your heart and stomp on it"
@Lirakitty Hard to tell if Skrillex will make Kanya worse, or if he's so bad on his own he literally couldn't.
@Lirakitty has to be something psychological. Freud would have a field day with modern liberals 
@Lirakitty hiding? nah...they aren't nearly sneaky enough for that. not even the 14 year old is. the 16 year old, she's closer, but not quite there either. 
@Lirakitty https://youtu.be/viI0DCC3eGo  This is my favourite atm other than GoT. and True Detective season 1
@Lirakitty I was trying to like the new doctor, Matt Smith was good in bursts, but his support was best. Tennant was charismatic and a great actor. Capaldi isn't bad, he is old though. Too old imo. but his acting is great, waiting a bit before watching more of the season
@Lirakitty I'd rather they do a miniseries like BBC Night Manager, than beat it until it dies and not tie loose ends
@Lirakitty if you endorse it I know it's garbage! on a side note I miss stargate universe.
@Lirakitty It makes a safer world in general haha :)
@Lirakitty It's true but was quite awesome for a pilot, glad the actors had something to continue on. I've moved on to Into the badlands and Preacher (Highly recommend) main actor/gf is from WoW movie king/queen (couple irl also?)
@Lirakitty just like better off ted :'(
@Lirakitty Nah, you're cool as shit.
@Lirakitty Preacher is fucking amazing pulp comic awesome.
@Lirakitty Tennant was amazing!
@Lirakitty Universe or new old dying doctor?
@LisaC2003 I'd do it in a second! (don't know how though)

@loki click in the spot where I highlighted, should open up the post   https://i.sli.mg/NjaJ4J.jpg
@loki hahaha ...did that help? Is that what you were looking for?
@loki hit the time stamp at the bottom right, then you have then option to expand the conversation and see all Post's involved
@loki not sure if it's what your looking for, but if you tap the "how many minutes ago" at the beginning of the notification, it opens up the post. If your not sure what I mean let me know I will screen shot it and show you.
@loki OK cool, if you have any other questions feel free to ask, if I know the answer I'll help. I know @a mentions are on fire, he tries to get back to everyone, but when notifications pour in it's hard not to miss some.

@lovelymissaubry I'm actually from shithole NE. To be specific, Scottsbluff. It's in the panhandle and like forty minutes away from Torrington, WY -- You heard? I have family in Laramie - So yeah, I'm definitely Midwestern ;)
@lovelymissaubry I've never really understood juggalos.  I mean I understand people like different music, but a shitty clown rap group?  It is lost on me.
@lovelymissaubry Looking back (why did I just Google search this?)/  I completely agree.  I'd be too afraid to touch them out of fear.
@lovelymissaubry much appreciated. My kidneys tried to kill me about 6 months ago and I'm still dealing with the fallout. 
@lovelymissaubry rape capital of europe for good reason

@lovelymissaubry what about grapes? In their fermented liquid form😉
@lovelymissaubry Yeah I've seen images that are burnt into my soul.    What I find even stranger is the amount of women there.  Luck stupid guys I can understand, but there are girls there that could probably do so much better.

@LR I'm one of the last people to advocate for more government oversight, but I almost think we need to apply free speech laws to private companies as well, not just government.  These companies don't restrict anything until everyone depends on them day to day.  It's hard for users to fight back.

@m Hi!
@m I am so happy you will be able to be alive again on the internet. SJW and jack must be so angry you can speak freely once more.
@m is a rapist and a pedophile why is he verified? 
@m Just listened to your first Rogan podcast interview. Wildly entertaining. (Caught the second one last week.) Thanks!

@m Ok, now you're just teasing us 😃 
@m Start posting stuff you little shit.  #Gab #MAGA
@m we're waiting for you, love.
@m Yay Milo!  #Gab is awesome
@MAD Interesting. As a private institution, they can choose to do whatever they like with their admissions policies. Do they have a genealogy to identify the descendants in question? I am interested in the practical application of this decision. If it makes them feel better...
@MAD Though I'm not sure what, if any, debt the living owe to the dead in this context.
@MAD Well then good for them. I hope that both groups benefit. The university can move forward with the perception of a cleaner conscience. And some people who might not otherwise benefit from a Georgetown education can get one.
@MAGA_VOTE It will not cause any issues on our end :)

@major I can't figure out how

@ManAtanasov sorry it's the underachieving is an extra thing I do. Over promise under deliver right?
@MaridanV As of this moment, you need to upload the photo somewhere else and then drop that link in the post (and it will pull it). The photo size for a post is about 470px x 200px.   Like this: https://gab.ai/Anns_Life/posts/131223
@MaridanV If you drop your blog link, it will pull (what looks to be) the twitter card (which includes your twitter text, url link and photo). Since your on blogger, that will work fine (google loves the schema they paid for).   Here's one I dropped off my blog: https://gab.ai/Anns_Life/posts/133200
@Markiplier you'll enjoy it more than twitter I think this place goes up to 11.
@MarkOutMedia hey! Don't rip on my countrymen
@MarkOutMedia how very superstitious of you  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
@MarkOutMedia I was lurking.  I normally don't watch #WWE shows Live, but I enjoy seeing people's reactions, and go back to watch any notable segments (like KO on Monday).  Most of my wrestling viewing is through the Network, so I don't get live shows.  I'll be sure to join in for #Backlash, though.
@MarkOutMedia right? I heard he ran some show but I can't confirm. Havent looked into it. 
@MarkOutMedia they built that finish well I was surprised Metallik kicked out too.  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
@MarkOutMedia this is why you get banned from everywhere  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
@MarkOutMedia well that sucks. 
@MarkOutMedia you don't think they're going to have Kendrick do favours in the final round?  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
@MarkOutMedia you were wrong!!!! Metallik won! Great match
@mattlyonanim @support #gabsupportlog Same thing happens when I search a username with a common word in it. For example, when searching "@support" I also get any posts with the word "support" being used in it.

@Michellejoz I absolutely agree with you, you're preaching to the choir sister! They will never accept any blame that falls on themselves.
@Michellejoz I also believe blacks kill more blacks than anyone else, perhaps there's a lesson in there, if anyone can pull their head out of their arse to learn.
@Michellejoz I don't "do" political on social media but I so agree with you I just had to comment.   Whenever I read "free stuff" I just shake my head and cringe. Some people are too stupid to breathe without help.  
@Michellejoz I don't want anyone to die, and it would be good if the police were properly prepared, but the chances are so small. I stood far more chance over 6 months in Northern Ireland, and we lost no one on our tour. All you can do is your job.
@Michellejoz I feel like there are good people working in our government, they just have to keep their heads down and bite their tongues at the moment. You can see a vestige of it in the Border Patrol Union supporting Trump IMO.
@Michellejoz I gotta slow down agree* breaking*
@Michellejoz I love you guy's reposting me typos and all 😂😂😂
@Michellejoz I took a friend I don't think she stood still for the whole show, yeah the best sober night of my life :-)
@Michellejoz I was right along side the band at the side, the heat from the flames was a huge surprise
@Michellejoz I wish this worked on mobile :(
@Michellejoz I've been told by someone that they blame Indiana because they can buy guns here.  I responded "Well fuck you if I don't want my rights restricted because you can't control your base urges."  I don't own any guns but it's the principle.
@Michellejoz It's always the same, take the guns from the law abiding and leave them in the hands of the criminals.
@Michellejoz It's not fair, I'm too old to call her anything but cute, she deserves more.
@Michellejoz Misery is our creed. It's absolutely essential to spread the wonderful word of Queen Clinton. #OhCarl
@Michellejoz Of course. The truth is the truth. 
@Michellejoz Oh and you're welcome... see my brains are scrambled
@Michellejoz or a liar...whatever works for you 😂
@Michellejoz So are you missy.
@Michellejoz Thank you Michelle
@Michellejoz thanks :) https://media0.giphy.com/media/10avZ0rqdGFyfu/200w.gif

@Michellejoz the #CtrlLeft you mean? 😬 
@Michellejoz The #FreedomBoner was singing the Star Spangled Banner, while my wife said the Pledge Of Allegiance, God Bless America  #TheBand  OG
@Michellejoz They did post at me but it got drowned out, just said they really didn't like me smh
@Michellejoz this is from the tour I saw #TheBand  https://youtu.be/wgG7cKlSTsM
@Michellejoz True. Hot.
@Michellejoz We can't even get enough armed police across the country, in a terrorist attack we are so screwed.
@Michellejoz We do our best, and try not to die along the way, some do, and not just in combat. We mourn them and carry on.
@Michellejoz We know that on this side of the pond far to well, it's why I collect sharp things, air guns, and bows.
@Michellejoz Well how about that? I'll have to take a look at this #TrumpLive and see what I can do to make you miserable. Miserable like a liberal. #OhCarl #HelloMichelle 
@Michellejoz Word! Maybe they could highlight links in another color. Or maybe I shouldn't be #GabbingDrunk.
@Michellejoz yeah it looked like they were liking posts but the points were going down, sorry it was 1500 points and an odd few
@Michellejoz you what?  Without telling a sumbitch, bye?  OG
@Michellejoz Yup, I found that feature but if you go to https://gab.ai/notifications it seems like that link isn't there.
@Michellejoz yup, that's exactly what I was looking for.
@Michellejoz 😘  Solid advice. 😍

@minniesalinas Have you read All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka? the recent Tom Cruise film was based on it.
@minniesalinas I haven't seen the film yet, I have the book and really enjoyed it.
@minniesalinas Thank you, for replying! Another Gabber, enlightened me. :)
@minniesalinas Wow. I was under the impression that Japan is rather safe.

@Moonman As a photographer I can tell you that cameras do not lie.  Photographers, on the other hand...  It's easy to make a crowd look as big, or small, as you want.
@mothyspace  You only respect something because a celebrity says it ?
@mothyspace He , @a knows it's part of his foray ask the celebrities you know, you follow to join you'd be surpride how many listen ... GABs the future 
@mothyspace me too! LOL.

@MPast92 #reasonstoGAB I am happy to reveal my true identity on GAB but on twitter I had to hide
@MPast92 Celebrating Trump's best speech yet!  You?  #MAGA 
@Msdefied A computer's the best way, Tracey, IMO. I can't imagine trying to find my way around a website on a phone. Hope you get on laptop or desktop soon! 
@Msdefied I honor you for your service, commitment, and courage.  
@Msdefied Never tried using one of those; I don't have one, just a computer, but I think you'll find it's a great place.
@Msdefied No worries, This T is a bit younger then, around 28. @Don would love to meet her also.
@Msdefied not sure if we know each other here as your profile is a bit unexpected, you live in London? But far distance family of @a?
@Msdefied Welcome to #Gab from a fellow #Navy veteran! I think you'll like it here.
@mslighthouse   @sg made one, too :) http://pastebin.com/xUtNrxY5    Plug it into Stylish Chrome/Firefox extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en
@mslighthouse can you upload a screenshot? I want to check it out 
@mslighthouse Needs more dark. Backgoround is too grey.
@Multimorten Agree, but hopefully self censorship here will take care of that stuff for the most part...losers will try & take advantage I'm sure
@Multimorten agreed man, went on a clicking storm till I was like   "calm down homie, it's beta"  I work for a software company, should probably be more understanding. So far, I like it a lot... will get pretty robust I imagine.
@Multimorten Ha! Yes, even better! Or it should delete their #Gab acct & redirect them to Twitter! lmao!!   Are you listening @a & @Support lol ;)
@Multimorten He must be somehow related to my Mother's side of the family
@Multimorten I know right?  SOMEONE EXPLAIN THIS WITCHCRAFT!
@Multimorten Omg I love this channel 😂 
@Multimorten suck my thick uncut cock man :) #FreeSpeech  Gab solidarity, love it! 
@Multimorten there is no such thing
@Multimorten 😂
@musicalmac If God didn't want them sheared, why did he make them sheep?
@musicalmac why would you?  1) feign "progressive" stance as a candidate, promising everything under the sun, free of charge.  2) collect "donations".  3) end your run by selling out. 4) profit!  it worked for Sanders.
@mw both parents were born and raised in poland.  one in Gorzow WLKP and one in Poznan.  They came to the states in the late 60s in NYC.  Moved to Houston in late 70s and had 2 kids, me and my brother.  I grew up in polish household so polish is all we knew when we started school.
@mw English is my 2nd language as well.. and polish was my first :)
@mw I like the idea of gab.tv . Kind of fits with the current domain name 😃 @a make it happen 😂
@mw I'm assuming you're Polish?
@mw ill talk to her in a couple of hours haha
@mw less than 70k in Texas. Maybe 50k if you're lucky. 
@mw Not really but 10+ years in hosting and linux administration
@mw so fkn underpaid.. so many of us here.  but not a lot of good admins, jsut average.  if you're REALLY good you'll pull in 200K in Texas
@mw thats awesome!  I am very bad at it now but in 1997 I was visiting and had no choice but to relearn it.  I'm trying to brush up on it now so I can speak with my mom in polish again.  
@n2xotps hi man, what you running?
@nacazo They take it too far. 
@nat @fys Same here!! It's better to burn out than to fade away!!
@nat @jesus that's nasty! Suppose some shitheads actually gets off on crap like that! Scary shit
@nat @shorty Soon...just waiting for the sun to go down.  https://i.sli.mg/PkEVAB.jpg
@nat ah that's sweet😉 Now, about cigar pics.....
@nat ah! If I could be half the man that Hitch was and die from booze and ciggies then I would be at peace! Gaping assholes?? WTF?
@nat ah! Ok. Now I am hurt....I don't have a Fam.....😢 I am a minority😭
@nat and just FYI I am a very responsible smoker...I don't smoke inside the house, only outside. 
@nat Best time ever on certain parts of the Autobahn (not Italy)... driving as fast as you can!! Love it!!
@nat But you're right next door to Germany aren't you?
@nat don't have a party on 420...
@nat for some reason I thought you were dutch, I apologise unreservedly.
@nat hahaha! I always share....my secret is that I smoke menthol...so hardly anybody wants them😉
@nat my hubby is half a #BritFam does that count? 
@nat oh and my mother in law is like 80+ and smokes like a chimney and the only thing wrong with her is arthritis.....figures, right?
@nat Picky picky :-p
@nat sorry...pics about cigars or Cuba? Little bit slow
@nat still cheap but yeah, having some Thai dude lying in a bed with half his dick or face rotten off just to scare you from smoking....nah! Not working
@nat the worst packs I have ever seen is in Thailand. Fucking hell😱🙀
@nat yeah they just seems to slip through my fingers...
@nathanwblair  She deals with retards professionally. It might be rubbing off on her. #PrayForMyMum
@nathanwblair he's a flavor for folks with all their teeth and walking around without a cane to help.
@nathanwblair I am analyzing this verbal menstruation right now. Despite his amazing speeches Queen Clinton still has a Trump card of her own. She's going to call him racist. Race card always wins. #OhCarl #RaceCardIsExpired
@nathanwblair I found out from @wall that Trump is the only person he is following on his personal twitter account  https://twitter.com/pewdiepie/following
@NegativeKelvin I can't wait to hear about it. 
@NegativeKelvin What do you think..
@neok1is #Brexit. Humanity's #Gamergate.
@neok1is Indeed, I do already although I think they've been quieter of late. I did have the thought once of creating a website called Comment Box for the stories TG don't allow comments on but my computer skills are verrrrry sketchy.
@Nick_Saint Just found yours. I've been trying my hands at one too!
@Nidstang welcome to the #GabFam 
@nightflight be careful you don't trigger 'it' by use of the word everyone.
@nightflight Hard to drink on a #Frog   You could sit beside him and #Share.
@nightflight I blocked him. I hated to go there but the things he was saying to our female Gabbers 'triggered' me.
@nightflight I don't want to risk keeping it up for free too long because I might violate the Terms of Service for my Kindle enrollment.  So if you wanna read my Lovecraftian styled story, "Amorphous Madness", here you can dl for free https://www.patreon.com/posts/amorphous-short-6571406
@nightflight I have a fantasy children's novel that I wrote (but I overedited it, so it needs to be reworked) that is very clean.  I wrote the story for my kids and was my first walk in self-publishing.  Last night, I did a #GabFam giveaway of my horror short that's currently available.
@nightflight It does have some gore in it, but the primary plot device is psychological terror.  You may like it or perhaps not, but I had about 10 gabbers last night who enjoyed it.
@nightflight Oh wow.  Thank you.  Hope you enjoy it.  I've been giving away to #GabFam since we are so exclusive right now, hehe.  :)
@nightflight Thanks!
@nightflight 😂😂😂 bring it 😆
@nightflight 😳😳
@Nightmouse Perhaps you could use this picture, add Gab.ai, and post it on your blog. You could also make the picture a hyperlink that leads to gab.ai. Any other suggestions @emily?  https://twitter.com/torbahax/status/768827407113478145 (Yea sorry I pulled it from twitter, sorry @a)
@NimbleCentipede  I agree with that but by God he has the right to come here and say it
@NimbleCentipede  Terms like "Men" is oppressive to beta fag like me. Please censor yourself immediately 
@NimbleCentipede *I

@NimbleCentipede >tfw you shitpost with the future prime minister of canada on a free speech message board
@NimbleCentipede @a Obviously I am on that list... Right?!
@NimbleCentipede Are you saying we (as in I) love all women?
@NimbleCentipede Done.
@NimbleCentipede got dat checkmark sooo yeah
@NimbleCentipede Haha yeah, full on satire. His name was DemsRRealRacist during the primaries. He slaughtered Cruz/Jeb!/Kasich for months.
@NimbleCentipede hopefully they do
@NimbleCentipede https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njczesGlXaQ I just found this
@NimbleCentipede I guess I'm not a womyn. 😔
@NimbleCentipede I knew you would, #IAmLoved 😍
@NimbleCentipede I think he might be a troll.
@NimbleCentipede If the past is any indication, probably a promt "suicide" via gunshot to the back of the head. I think I've already said too much. Let's meet in Yellowknife if it goes bad.
@NimbleCentipede If they witness her in the act of committing a felon, the answer is technically yes, even if she is under Secret Service protection.
@NimbleCentipede just chilling n seeing the rapids
@NimbleCentipede Just doing our part!
@NimbleCentipede MEXICO WAS NEVER GREAT chants we wont hear in the streets there
@NimbleCentipede My thoughts exactly!
@NimbleCentipede Still a pretty big if.
@NimbleCentipede thank you.. trying the best I can, every day..
@NimbleCentipede the dancing one on the ellen show one tho
@NimbleCentipede WEW! 
@Nironavro   >> I've spent my whole life being afraid of saying the wrong  >> thing or doing something that might offend someone. I'm >> done walking on eggshells.  It's quite a liberating feeling, isn't it? :)
@nironavro #GabQueers and proud!
@Nironavro vs me an i am the elephant in the room. I will say the wrong thing just to get the conversation started even if i dont believe in it :P spicy like that
@Nironavro you should have seen me as EO in the army. I knew the EO senior instructor and he told me the best way to open a dialog is to do it the hard way. So day one he had me walk into class and say damn If i knew i was gonna be the only white guy i would have brought fried chicken and tacos
@Noah why can't a trucker get some followers
@NoSharia They're good at warfare. Extremely efficient.  Even if the all the issues were resolved between islam world and the west. Their tactics will be used by many different organizations. To terrorize the innocent or to topple government tyranny. The game of warfare has changed because of it.
@Nothing2serious According to her, even today, she's the only person allowed to bully me.  Her nickname for me has always been "Little Turd".
@Nothing2serious But if that had been a white teen and a 5-year-old black girl, the teen's family would have to leave the country.  So fucking sick of the double-standard system in this country!!!
@Nothing2serious Haha, no. But I know why you said that.
@Nothing2serious I actually knew a guy back in college that would chow down on uncooked ramen packets. Not often, but he did. 
@Nothing2serious I'm fairly laid back and can laugh off many things, but this....  My blood is boiling.
@Nothing2serious When I was 5, I had an almost 300lb teen who bullied me.  My older sister, 5'2" 90lbs soaking wet got on the bus with me the next day.  She reached into her boot, pulled out her 6 inch lock blade knife and put it right on the guy's throat when he started in on me.  No more bullying.

@NotMyUserName  This is actually quite impressive. I've never had a conversation entirely out of memes.  /tips fedora/

@NotMyUserName I'm afraid of a liberal invasion when everyone gets triggered and abuses the report button. Luckily we have good devs/admins. I think the button should only be used if it the post is something illegal (ex. Drug dealing, joining ISIS) or possibly intense gore.
@NotMyUserName I've been wondering about that with regard to gab itself. Yes, the platform supports free speech. But will it support the advocacy of anti-western sentiments? Does gab need a great wall? What say you, @a?
@NotMyUserName Just waiting for his delegates to come back to his grazing fields. The delegates will come back home. #OhCarl #GabNation
@NotMyUserName oh noes redacted BTFO  #HowCouldYou

@NotMyUserName Slanted and dated, wish there was a newer one that didn't put everyone on a 2006 spectrum
@NotMyUserName Tell Jesus to get back over the wall #SaySomethingOffensive
@NotMyUserName Well, I have been known to advocate views which most westerners consider anathema (e.g. return to monarchy/empire; a confessional State, etc.), but which are nonetheless deeply western. Still, I can respect & abide by a secular order. A discussion of platform values would be welcome.
@NotMyUserName you have yourself a good night. Sleep well. #OhCarl
@NotMyUserName you killed me. Wasn't expecting that. #OhCarl
@nowhere_nh And yes, I screwed up and called Women's equality Day "Nat'l Women's Day" the day of, but who cares? They're the same thing: self-aggrandizing opportunities for idiot feminists to talk abt how wonderful they are while ignoring 3rd world hellholes that treat women as 2nd class citizens.
@nowhere_nh C'mon. It was a sucker bet.
@nowhere_nh Well, dogs are loyal.D&R  Seriously though, I'll never get this slavishly narcissistic culture."OMG! Someone is talking about something besides me! Burn them!"  So what?Who cares?Grow the fuck up, everything isn't about you.  
@ns @shorty "needle"
@ns @shorty "shitting" jeez! I swear I am losing it 😳
@ns @shorty I think you will be shutting throught the eye of a needle💩
@ns @shorty it was suppose to be @nat but the more the merrier! Fuck, need to switch from the iPad back to the laptop. Either that or I am getting pissed already hahahaha
@ns @shorty Too many conversations at the same time...olive oil, cigars.... Fuckit now I am hungry too!
@ns and the worst part of it was that we were doing a game drive in the African bush at the time....we couldn't get out of the car to escape the damage done in the nappy. After exiting the park, we pulled over found a hose pipe and hosed her ass down it was so bad! Bad parents😱
@ns bad lol
@ns I don't know about your body, but mine won't handle that much fat at one sitting. 
@ns I expect most of it would. Quickly.
@ns I'll bet you'd poop a lot.
@ns I'm no scientist, but I truly believe you may become italian, and if you hit the right amount maybe a mario bro.
@ns I've never seen a study done on this
@ns nah! My daughter at a packet of my smokes when she was about 2 years old....by accident of course....but it was FUNNY watching her face at the time!!! Not so funny when I had to clean her diapers though💩😱
@NurseWho Elective and purely aesthetic procedures should not be funded by taxpayers. If you personally want to do something to your body, go for it, but don't dismiss people and ostracize them because they personally don't agree with it, like I don't. Everyone can have opinions!
@NurseWho Her low self-esteem in that regard might be temporarily fixed, but in my experience, low self-esteem is best combatted with positive reinforcement from your peers and support. Yes it's always evolving, but physical solutions shouldn't be the first way to address mental illness.
@NurseWho I believe that if we just told people to look in the mirror and love yourself as you are, physically and mentally, instead of changing your appearance to cave to society's ideas, everyone would be much happier. #LoveEachOther
@NurseWho I personally believe that modifying your physical appearance due to a mental discrepancy is not the answer, especially when those modifications can lead to health problems that would never have occurred otherwise.
@NurseWho It could also be argued that lobbing off entire limbs because your internal perception identifies as legless is a mental illness, but lobbing off your penis isn't. #SaySomethingOffensive
@NurseWho it is possible, but it's much easier to do it in post. If they tried to blur it live there could have been a gap where it wasn't blurred in the beginning  or the tracking gets messed up and it would show and that'd be a much bigger disaster for them, safer just to do it for the reruns. 
@NurseWho Lol, and now YouTube too! Can't have "politics" or anything "sensitive" monetized now can we?
@NurseWho the sad thing is he's a production guy, and he knows all of this ... But his lefty brain squashes and incinerates like the Hillary emails any logic that may pop up and try to make an appearance.  
@nutbunny  Momentous? Yah!  Brexit, thing? Nah,  just another Friday on #Gab, Fam. #FreedomFriday
@nutbunny #FreedomFriday always gets you off. Almost there... 1 more sleep, #GabFam http://i.giphy.com/EZfSD2dj78kQ8.gif
@nutbunny @Des I know back then they were quit good, actually my father was part of a special team there back in the 80'. Garankuwa area.
@nutbunny @Globalalpha yes, you should have sucked....the harder, the better 😃 
@nutbunny Aewsome! If only those two brothers knew that back in the day, all SA special forces teams were trained by the Israelis and Mossad....hahaha
@nutbunny Good for your brother! 
@nutbunny I had to laugh out loud at this one regarding the police 😂 Yes, not much has changed I see!!! Just glad that when they are actually required to do their job they are on the ball!!
@nutbunny I know, right? There has never been any problems like this in SA before....well, aside from some PAGAD bombs here and there a long time ago...but still....nothing like this, EVER!
@nutbunny Interesting. Have you seen a sudden, large influx of Muslim migrants into SA though?
@nutbunny Is there specific groups in SA being infultrated right now that you know of? How does the government handling it?
@nutbunny Just traveled to Cape Town 3 weeks ago and I was shocked to see the amount of Burka clad woman everywhere. It never use to be like that. It felt like I was back in Dubai TBH
@nutbunny Shit! This is not good news. I wonder how many sleeper cells they have in SA? The rest of the world is pretty much only focusing on Europe, US and North Africa. If they infiltrate from the Southern tip of Africa, Africa is pretty much screwed
@nutbunny Thanks 😃 
@nutbunny That is good to know. It is a pitty that there are good Muslims sitting right in the center of it all. I am an atheist, so no special preferences for any religion. In the end it will boil down to the Muslim communities to take on the extremists as we are merely outsiders to the faith
@nutbunny That makes sense. Over here I'm hearing rumbling about various groups in Central and South America working with the cartels. I've even heard about camps down south.
@nutbunny The mind boggles..lots of Saffers working in those institutions and some of them brown/black so really they are just fucked up in the mind. As for capitalist pigs, why the fuck do they even have smartphones, these little fuckers 😂 
@nutbunny Very well put! I really hope the Muslim community in SA is strong enough to filter this lot out, cause in the UK and Europe it seems a losing battle
@nutbunny What!! That news certainly has not traveled this far. Didn't even know about it! So this is actively a thing in SA? We received travel warnings not too long ago advising against malls etc in SA, but nobody really took it serious here. Please do me a favor and link me some articles 
@nutbunny Wow! And let me guess.... they also blame South Africa's foreign policy and our bombings of Syria and the Middle East!! It's a fucking joke how they justify killing innocents for their beliefs
@nutbunny Wow, didn't know that! I am surprised that the local populace has allowed this to happen, considering how Xenophobic they are regarding Africans from other African countries. Was not too long ago they were burning Zimbabweans and Malawians with tyres
@nutbunny Yummier! And more nutritious. #FreedomFriday Nomnomnom wew! http://i.giphy.com/QNZn5pG43P2Vi.gif
@NWConservative And yeah, I'll take a lot of things over Jar Jar any day...
@NWConservative I was afraid you would bring up those 3... I actually think Lucas had an evil/untalented twin brother that killed him after Empire Strikes Back and took over. That also explains the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. #ConspiracyTheories #ProbablyTrue
@NWConservative Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm offended. I applaud you :P  I enjoyed the latest Star Wars btw, but I think someone had writer's block...
@NWConservative There is only one reason to stay on Twitter. #BannedFromTwitterCompetition When Gab goes out of Beta, we need to have a "Getting Ban from Twitter Competition" and we need to do it all on the same day.
@NWConservative This makes me cringe (a third death star!?!?!?)
@oath Also I like @Nick_Saint's one the most :)
@oath basically removing any monetary motivation for speaking on topics they disagree with or as they put it "controversial topics". They even unmonetised videos relating to mental health on MrRepzion's channel.
@oath Community guideline stuff 
@oath definitely checking it out! And looks like there's someone else on there as well when you search Gab!
@oath did that, also tried pulling it manually and splitting. replaced the basic, used --cacert all pulled 60, can't -k around it. tested elsewhere I could do insecure and it let me bypass.
@oath easy solution: ad companies can specify topics/on certain channels of YouTube in which they don't want their adverts to be played. I.e. a chicken company removing their ads from vegan promoting channels should be a-ok.
@oath g'day mate how are we
@oath got it fam
@oath haha don't stress too much, been going through stack overflow boards and tech help forums reading errors on it. Thanks though!
@oath https://i.sli.mg/FGIABx.png
@oath I thought that might be it. So originally i did x64 installation, then did a fresh x86 install. same issues
@oath Is it too late? Has the moment passed?
@oath It's probably as HTML would be to learn as the two are sort of connected.
@oath Oh cool! CSS looks really interesting to learn!
@oath Sadly, this is the generation where gamers are paying for games that are either not out yet (via pre-orders and Steam early access) or don't actually exist (via KickStarter).
@oath taking monetzation of people's videos for talking about certain things
@oath thanks though, i've wasted hours on this small issue that running native would probably fix. I wouldn't smash your head anymore trying to figure it out! much appreciated
@oath The more you learn. I myself have been learning Python but CSS/HTML looks to be really valuable to learn!
@oath What was the code written in for the first one?
@oath Wow, that's really interesting. I'll definitely bookmark this site! 
@oath Yeah they can have some weird questions, but some tests offer an option to suspend judgment. A lot of them have a libertarian bias as well. This isn't my actual result. I've tried to get this result on purpose just to see if I could and it still put me pretty low on the scale. Weird.
@obama @biden quit fucking golfing and come #speakfreely you Marxist badtards!!
@ObeseReese #TwExit am i right?!
@ObeseReese thanks, call me Max
@ObeseReese That ALONE would have gotten you banned at the other place. LOL
@ObeseReese welcome bruh
@objetdarth   But to mend fences with those who suffer from pumpkin-spice attraction, I offer this APPROPRIATE use of both pumpkin and the spices associated therewith. Please note, use REAL pumpkin, cooked and pureed, and not the dyed acorn squash in a can.  http://bit.ly/2bLiIpi
@objetdarth  -Flagging posts is available now.   -Flagging a post will report it to us.   -Please do not abuse this feature   
@objetdarth  Pumpkin spice is a godsend! 
@objetdarth But seriously, what the fuck is it with #Halloween candy and merchandise at the stores in August?
@objetdarth Egads. Why are some so hell bent on creating so-called solutions to imaginary problems?  
@objetdarth I far in your general direction.
@objetdarth I know they have have some pretty "heart-wrenching" and "soul searching" debates on campus about what it means to be a "Catholic" institution. They have for years. Other than a religion/philosophy general ed requirement I don't know that they are a Catholic school.
@objetdarth Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time.
@objetdarth Well, it's not like I was actually using my soul...
@oceancucumber cool what you playing atm?
@oceancucumber doom's been on sale a lot lately I'll been tempted to buy
@oceancucumber not yet, I'm writing isolated micro-services in Scala to accomplish that. Since I have to keep adding features and fix bugs at the same time, it might take some time.
@odinfyre Not stressed, just want to get the message out :) Tough to answer the same question 50 times a day haaha. 
@Offendatron5000 When you get all hopped up on caffeine would you come and mow my yard for me?  
@OG  Aw thanks! And remember, if you're stuck on Facebook surrounded by uninteresting viewpoints, like my page!  https://m.facebook.com/runawayitslogic/  I write on controversial topics and post the dankest of memes on politics, feminism and those silly SJWs.  
@OG  Clicking on the "little triangle".  At least, that's what the nuns told the girls….
@OG  In Catholic School, that was called a 'mortal sin'….

@OG @mf I was but a simple passenger in the back of the tour bus.  #TheBand
@OG @michellejoz #TheBand  I'll keep that in mind.
@OG @QQ Heh, I just know where the speed traps are. Avoid Hollywood, SC near Edisto Island. Those deputies are brutal. #TheBand

@OG Bad-ass Rare for a bad-ass Woman --> @rose. 
@OG Could that speech have been any more f***ing awesome! #DicksOutForAmerica
@OG Fuck right! As it should be 
@OG hahaha another tragedy averted thanks to @e
@OG Happy to help a #GabFam, brother. We are #TheBand after all... And it's nearly #FreedomFriday! Wew, what a time to be alive.
@OG he is One of the best, isn't he!? We had a great convo last night! So many awesome people here! #ProudMom
@OG he's the best!! 
@OG I don't mind a good trolling, mindless vandalism is pointless, but that's just my opinion.
@OG I dunno... This? https://i.sli.mg/wx4F9a.png
@OG I feel like Don't Fear The Reaper should be in the running b/c of @praisekek's succint use of the cowbell meme.  However, Kid Rock Born Free would also be good.  #TheBand
@OG I think #TheBand needs to quit #Jammin and #GetToWork #Slackers 😘🐸
@OG I think I will need to investigate this further #TheBand #ProtectTheGabHouse 
@OG I told all sumbitches goodnight, you musta missed it  😀😉💕
@OG I'm on it! #SeeYouOnTheFlipSide 
@OG I've only ever felt like that twice in my life, both times I woke up in a police cell http://i.giphy.com/HcOEIF4Yhikhi.gif  #theband
@OG just @WRM posting a picture of me. 
@OG lol!! So happy to know my kids aren't the only ones who did that!! #Ha #GoinFishin 
@OG Night, G
@OG no law enforcement? What fun could that be? #BringOnThePolice
@OG oh believe me, it was. Just ask my buddy @Globalalpha
@OG oh... But he was such a good boy yesterday. What did you all do to corrupt him?   #TheBand  I'm not sure I like this idea... #GabFam 
@OG Partying with #TheBand  http://media.giphy.com/media/PNwaNXiP6ubw4/giphy.gif

@OG Thanks OG!    I feel cooler than I actually am when I type OG ...
@OG totally small world! Glad to see you on here!
@OG Uh, OK then. But I don't stop for pee breaks #TheBand  *Getting flashbacks of Rueben from The Partridge Family*
@OG ummm #BrokenToilet is kind of a big deal! #GetToIt 🚽
@OG waiting on that #EditButton myself ! Perhaps you need a nap? want me to take over? 
@OG Well you can walk away from them when it's just words, and that's the best thing you can do.
@OG Well, I only drive manuals...
@OG yee boiii 
@OG yes #NeverSurrender #TheBand
@og yes born in UAMS but lived in Conway most of my life
@OG You get to buy new pants! #TheBand
@OG 😂😂😂
@OG 😍😘❤️💕
@Ohme Noooooooooooo
@OilCan "Offensive" in liberalspeak is anything that is said in opposition to them.
@OilCan Oh my God, that is great. I will write something about this for the others at HotGas to look out for. Getting banned on Twitter will be fun!
@OilCan RIIIIGHT?! 
@OilCan Yes! I say this all the time.
@OldSchoolVinny fuck u 
@Oligarchicide + @Limbrepair welcome to the fray, boys.  https://i.sli.mg/1zxVEN.gif
@ontore they're doubling down, the end is nigh
@OP is a faggot
@Orose welcome. We have home schooled our teenagers since1st & 2nd grade. Good on you for giving 3rd wave feminism the finger.
@oskarwpl Not in Sweden Send women
@oskarwpl you have my sympathy and may god have mercy on your soul o7
@oskarwpl you need guns, ammo, and the constitution in your life. #America
@oskarwpl You want the blue helmets of the U.N.?
@oskarwpl yup, Dane
@OtherRealm Also scorpions!
@OtherRealm Comics, the irony however, is that I'm too busy working on comics to actually read them at the present time.
@OtherRealm what do I like to read?  Minds  
@p0p Not only that, if you're not failing from time to time, it means you're not trying new things.  #Trump has been constantly branching out and experimenting to find new ways to spread his brand and make money.  The fact that only a few of these ventures went bankrupt is a sign of his success. 
@p2  they're all probably in your spam folder.
@p2 Being a liberal is being a hypocrite. It would be shocking  if they accepted the outcome. I believe there will be some degree or attempt to rig on their part. Hopefully Donald Trump throwing up flags about it scares them though.
@p2 now you can undo
@p2 yeah they've no doubt depressed their voter turn out with their actions. I can't wait for post debate polls lol
@p2 yeap, there will also be an input to hear your reason.
@p2 Yes it is! A complete explanation can be given when arguing with an idiot... Bring on the idiots, I'm prepared to battle wits. Need spell checker and grammar fixer though. hahahaha 
@p2 you deserve faster 👍 
@p_j_e a bunch of people I don't know and that don't know me. Lol.  No reason to either.    
@p_j_e exactly! I was a little bit pissed at him for making it sound that we are all a bunch of basement shitheads
@p_j_e Lol, I did not know of this one. Not surprised in the slightest.
@p_j_e yes! Last time I looked I was a real person, not a fucking robot!!
@Parachutes-N-Ladders #Always 🇺🇸 #TheUltimateSacrifice 
@Parachutes-N-Ladders did you get a reply?
@Parachutes-N-Ladders HA HA HA HA, oh god, pretty much what I JUST posted!!! LOL! LOVE IT! #ImWithHillary #GabFam
@Parachutes-N-Ladders I have NO GUILT whatsoever for being what, or who I am. No-one should.  It's so counter-productive. Serves no purpose at all to advance society. 
@Parachutes-N-Ladders I'm triggering and I find this transgendered!
@Parachutes-N-Ladders should call it the Cuckington Post @Carlcuck #OhCarl
@Parachutes-N-Ladders 😘 Always!!
@PCGlasses Steven's position is the 2nd doesn't contain an implied right to personal self defense, it only protects a state's right to raise a militia. To get there, he attempts to redefine the terms in it in a way that is inconsistent with the rest of the constitution & the english language.
@PeninaChan no I am not 
@PeninaChan so how is the game 
@Pepe_Memes as long as you use sugar AND fat free water.
@Pepe_Memes Good morning Pepe. How is your day starting? #OhCarl
@pepe_memes how did you become a shitposting master
@pepe_memes who did you piss off? Looks like someone has gone through your profile and downvoted everything. Lmao.   https://i.sli.mg/CGSIHI.jpg
@PepeSmurf All things considered no don't
@PepeSmurf MAKE ME
@pete  http://i.imgur.com/wnIaRyJ.gif     
@pete  It is truly mind boggling how utterly weak they are. 
@pete #NutritionTips  probiotics are probably a waste of money... the calcium is important though
@pete 'Lock Her Up' is the next one lol
@pete 100% true. Has it always been scheduled like that? Never payed an election any mind till the God Emperor. Seriously he gets me so pumped. 
@pete @lvrbrtsn That is disgusting. You have to wonder what is wrong with some people.
@pete Agreed, crybullies, the lot of them.  This is why it's important to build up sites like TechRaptor, NicheGamer and LewdGamer so we can have a ethical, anti-censorship and pro-consumer gaming press.
@pete Alright
@pete atleast it wasn't a diseased ejaculating dick.  #PositiveGabs
@pete Awesome! Thanks for the follow #GabFam #MAGAfam
@pete B and C vitamins
@pete dittoooo 
@pete From what I've heard, even they got hit with demonetization.
@pete Hey, get me that #KoalaBear yet?
@pete Hopefully once #Gab goes live we will start seeing developers join.  In my case I'm looking forward to see many Japanese developers #SpeakFreely here compared to other platforms.
@pete I can imagine, I never used that so I have my account 
@pete I can't wait one tv to watch my packers and another for the debate. Double entertainment, I don't know if I can take so much winning. 
@pete I have a PSN
@pete I have so much love to give to the #NewToGab #GabFam y'all  http://cdn1.dolimg.com/en-US/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GENIE-HUG-GIF.gif
@pete I HAVE SO MUCH LOVE TO GIVE! Like a pack of corgi puppies 🐶   http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t3_XWGjGPcw/UCDLQDLjIYI/AAAAAAAAR_c/ZXzNiMrRrLc/s1600/009-funny-animal-gifs-corgi-puppies.gif
@pete I just bought a boat, so I've been doing the boat thing lately instead of playing games. Will probably purchase Doom soon though.
@pete I know they bite and scratch and spit and stuff, but  I want one anyways. Chlamydia and all.
@pete I think Sean Murray is definitely giving Derek Smart and Peter Molyneux runs for their ill-gotten gains.
@pete I'm right here! And I aint neva scurred.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryIjCkw3Jfg
@pete In the case of DoAX3 it's worse than that, since they went of their way to fling shit at it even though it isn't available in the west because KT was afraid of this very shit flinging.
@pete lol thanks!
@pete Looks to be a bug brother.
@pete no one's scared of Twitter Ripoff #28573 trust me
@pete No sports. Unless you consider #FrogJumping a sport.
@pete oh lol, then i've seen even less Canadians here how's Australia, don't you feel silly having winter in August? 😮 
@pete Probably heard it from Reddit haha. I love that trump has supporters not even from the USA. Yet Killary has to pay for people to shill. Amazing. 
@pete Thank you!
@pete thank you! :)
@pete Thank you, Pete, for posting the stream info. I don't have cable TV, so now I can watch Trump's rally. :)
@pete thanks man it was also just the kind of thing I was looking for to do at the same time as grad school
@pete thanks Mr. Payne
@pete that's so true, i think i've seen like 1 other canadian here lol
@pete the Donald hit it out of the park. I'm bathing in liberal tears of fear and anguish right now.
@pete There's no other explanation.
@pete They are allowing ban repeals since it was kind of dumb http://techraptor.net/content/niantic-repealing-some-pokemon-go-bans
@pete until 'it' tags you. but the reduction in volume is nice.
@pete what's your @ on twitter? i love this website so far, it's kinda like reddit+twitter combined
@pete yep. As oceancucumber.
@pete you give them too much credit 
@pete you're welcome! we will rule 👑 #FirstNameClub
@pete 😉
@phil have you ever played Golden Sun for GBA?
@phil Having the best shits?
@phil I've never actually played any FF games, but I am intrigued by the open world nature and fun-looking battle style of the upcoming FFXV. What's your opinion on the game so far?
@phil lol. Once I get to 1,000 followers I will post a special video for my #Gab #Gabbers #GabFam . No nude promises though.  http://bit.ly/2bVBiP5  #SpeakFreely
@phil or lentils...
@phil There is a lot of good description here, along with links to various protocols:  https://www.onnit.com/academy/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/
@phil Yes this is true. However, Barbara Streisand could certainly pull it off. I say we hold her to it! 
@Phillip What'd I do?? Why does everyone keep saying bad things about me!!?
@PhillyD  https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0BKnPm8RnFvYu7WE/giphy.gif
@PhillyD  It says parody? Gosh and I already sent it to the real phil. Maybe that will make him actually show up here and check it out. Leave it up!
@PhillyD  Phil is it you say something on your snapchat
@PhillyD  The worst part is I only heard of 'you' today so I can disect the wording of your posts to see if you're real!
@PhillyD #Youtube #censorship #LiberalLogic  Soo censoring someone for their hostile opinions .....  But apparently this is OK:  #NSFW (but your kids can find it for FREE on YouTube)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Kv0dvQ4kA 
@PhillyD (if it's real)  Price of #FreeSpeech She is the abuser of the lyft driver. She happens to have a lot of ties with feminist movements.   https://i.sli.mg/yoeOYs.png  #GabFam #SpeakFreely
@PhillyD <3 u too, I have to say fam that was some top tier effort trolling right there. Appreciate you adding parody to the account. 
@PhillyD Amen brother.
@PhillyD Better make sure Hillary doesn't find it.
@PhillyD https://i.sli.mg/p58ln1.jpg
@PhillyD I know its not you because this is too patriotic for you. 
@PhillyD LOL!!! 
@PhillyD my sister used to watch your videos all the time, I did not.  I'd like you know if you're cool and what video should I watch since I've never seen your work 
@PhillyD Nay, let it burn, and Gab will feast on the ashes.
@PhillyD The best tool. Our tool. Awesome tool, good job @Tool.
@Physicsgeek I was getting tired of people using the #SaySomethingOffensive tag and making true statements rather than saying truly offensive things.  Now shut your festering gob, you tit. Your type makes me puke. 
@pikari   pikari the gift that keeps giving :) thanks for that! You're too kind.

@pinroot Exactly, it doesn't take much for her to jump to war. 
@Piratepigeon @w8 s my boy. Do we need to throw down? 
@Piratepigeon Hmm...  CNN: "Trump Uses Dark and Violent Language in Fiery Anti-Immigrant Tirade"  MSNBC: "Trump Doubles Down on Racism and Hate in Immigration Rant"  NBC: "Trump Returns to Base With Angry Address After Disastrous Meeting in Mexico"
@Piratepigeon I was close!  https://i.sli.mg/XtgzTL.jpg

@political That is assuming he did and there ever were.  Sometimes skepticism is a good thing.  
@PollySpin  God PC Culture is absolutely F'ing awful 
@PollySpin but they were almost broke when they left the White-house, Hillary said so 
@PollySpin cat herder? That's funny. Hopefully not overrun. 
@PollySpin I laughed at the MeeMaw... love TBBT
@PollySpin I love Walmart:)
@PollySpin I want sanctuary from the IRS. Federal law says I have to pay. Federal law says illegals have to be kicked out.
@PollySpin on the plus side, it wont be long before they all forget why they "claim" to be oppressed 
@PollySpin thanks for the follow 🙂 
@PollySpin That is total bullshit.  It is history.  Ugh the dumbness hurts.
@PollySpin The analysis also found that Clintons’ representatives, between 2001, when the Clintons left the White House, and the end of this year, had requested allocations under the Act totaling $16 million.  
@PollySpin this is a HUGE deal & no one cares. You are dead on.
@PollySpin What a joke.
@PollySpin Yay!  Today I put on clothes and I feel human. Mostly. Not really. 
@poorboy Azure blob storage is taking it's sweet ass time with me too today.
@poorboy Just swapped to Brave broswer and it's fine
@porn  you still like biocunts? da fook is wrong with you? Waifus are the best.

@PortableNiche bunch of man baby pussies the lot of them - ign, kotaku

@Powerclam   Did JohnTitor know the visionary   Titot might be the best to recruit Art Bell though John Titor TIME TRAVEL - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQJfNViicuA 
@Powerclam  protect, I mean. Man, that's one embarrassing typo :( #TrumpLive
@Powerclam , you've earned tonight's first hot and spicy tendie from Hillary's official Facebook page!  🐔  #Trump #FreedomBoner #MAGA #Gab #GabGam  https://sli.mg/AXTktq
@Powerclam aahh shit!
@Powerclam Agree 100%
@Powerclam And I can't click it on my own post, and I'm not gonna pull the #DickTrigger on someone else, so.....? #WTF #Gab?
@Powerclam He can make heads explode? Wow. that's actually a talent. That's my new favourite thing about #Trump. I'm actually a bit jealous. 
@Powerclam I don't see many having the stones to join.No hiding place to feel all safe here.
@Powerclam I hope so....
@Powerclam I stand corrected 
@Powerclam I suspect it's closer to how an autistic person feels. Deaf people develop really good lip-reading skills (and are probably better at reading non-verbal cues than most hearing people).
@Powerclam I'm 99% sure we won't see much of Milo until the mobile app is released. He did most of his tweeting from his phone.
@Powerclam LOL
@powerclam pardon? Do we know each other?
@Powerclam right! I had to go to your wall to get the reply button. No way to reply via Notifications. #uxbug
@powerclam Right! No worries fam.  (Does this thing do regular replies and threading? Or is this how I reply #newfagquestions)
@Powerclam so many jobs a synch
@Powerclam the latter. They've got some virtue to signal.
@Powerclam Why thank you :) And you supporting Trump doesn't bother me. To each their own!
@Powerclam Yeah...
@Powerclam yes it does.  And I fixed the spacing, how does it look now?
@Powerclam yes That is awfully too true  :(   #TrumpLive
@Powerclam You would think so, but they're also just that brazen. Also, Hillary's campaign has to weigh the risk both ways; the optics might be bad to have her propped up on a couch, but they'd be worse if she collapsed halfway through the debate also. 
@PraiseKek enshrined upon the $1 bill he watches over us all.

@PrisonPlanet Well at least the article didn't try to convince us he was really a Frenchman.
@ProfessorPepe I bet his next post will be him announcing he has a book deal. Everyone's gotta write a book. I doubt he would be trolling cause that would be very sincere. He doesn't strike me as the sincere type. #OhCarl

@radaluvvy And that's the way it should be! At least you and a few other conscious people are right in the head.
@radaluvvy bug reported, fixing soon
@radaluvvy never wd have guessed.
@radaluvvy Shall I start a fan club?
@radaluvvy Thanks, it's nice to find a place on the net with like minded people! 
@radaluvvy too selfish.
@radaluvvy well said
@radaluvvy yeah protein is super important  make sure she gets enough iron, calcium and b12 too  green leafy veg, legumes and cheese/dairy   #NutritionTips for those who wouldn't pass my bacon immigration test
@radaluvvy Yeah, gotta love them Error 500s.  Time for The Commute for me, though. Back in a bit.
@radaluvvy Yeah, it's my bedtime, surprised to see you here.

@Radazex  that's gay!
@RadicalCath *unsuccessfully monetizes
@RadicalCath Mind Blown!
@RadicalCath Right on, that's cool. I feel the same way. I want an open discussion so we can talk about ALL the facts.
@RadicalCath That's actually a good question. What happens if/when #Gab gets swarmed by pro-ISIS shitbags posting links to their fucking murder videos? And if/when #Gab allows direct uploads... It's #BoldExperiment and humans always find a way to disappoint, so we'll see... 
@RadicalCath the only prob with the #islamiscancer is that if MSM catch on to it there be able to post headlines such as: radical lorry drives at shoppers on high st, no injurys but 127 people were killed by cancer. more ways to hide the fact that islam kills  
@RadicalCath This is a good question. What do you think?
@Rafael hey mate, what exactly are you studying? I'm working in IT at the moment in an entry level position 
@RagnarLothbrok disgusting gif but so true, they have nothing to shit on Trump with, so they make it up! 
@RagnarLothbrok I try not to be so hard on ol' Jeb.  When he tweeted the picture of a gun with his name engraved on it: that gave him a ton of "bad ass" points in my book.  No, not Trump's level of bad-assery, but: bad-ass nonetheless.
@randomdude But theres an L in my name fam :/
@randomdude FuckedCompany -- now THAT is a site that should have stayed around...
@randomdude I took a vacation.
@randomdude I've come to the horrible realization that @a will never let me have @twitter. So I had to step away to collect myself and pick up all the pieces of my broken heart :/
@randomdude that's a given. but i've got the contingencies. and the practice, since they are #3 and #4. 
@RandomScotsman free the glans.... Not as snappy. Free the labia just doesn't roll off the tongue.  More like free the idiots. 
@RandomScotsman now I have to know this shit exists, thanks man #CanNotUnsee
@RandomScotsman pendulous 
@RandomScotsman they could be trapped in there! Who will go in to save them? Won't someone think of the children?   
@RandomScotsman we want the right to have skin cancer on top of a breast cancer
@RandomScotsman when do gentlemen walk around topless? Never.  Even at the beach, a person in a 3  piece suit is always looking classy.  
@RandomScotsman women.  That's what real women look like.  Surely, there are several women under that blanket.
@RaptorJesus Completely agree.   I believe, based upon my conversations, that the DNC base is depressed (Bernouts, etc) and #Trump supporters can be shy/quiet in many places (especially in more liberal cities/circles).  #Trump turnout should be huuugge.
@RaptorJesus Doesn't #Trump know it's illegal to own a bitch like that?
@RaptorJesus Those damn Republicans!  In all seriousness, they'll complain like petulant children about voter fraud it they have lower turnouts and lose.  Which will be a level of irony that might trigger a supermassive black hole.   I know I'll be waiting with popcorn.  #MAGA
@rarepepe #PostSelfieOrRiot
@rarepepe Absolutely. My problem is I lack structure and motivation in my life. I think something like school will help me develop those things and keep me on my toes. Also give me a paper for at least a foot in the door. However, I do plan on doing all that you mentioned while attending school.
@rarepepe Ah
@rarepepe Are you black?
@rarepepe Both the Royal college of physicians and public health england have conducted their own studies, compared to tobacco cigarettes ecigs are at least 95% safer due to no combustion. Unfortunately too many anti ecig people abuse ecigs in ways no human could tolerate to get the data they want
@rarepepe Debt is the only reason I really keep procrastinating on school. Who knows, maybe I'll get what I need from school before finishing an entire 4 years. I'm still contemplating a lot, but I'm hoping to come to a decision before the end of this year.
@rarepepe Give it time. 
@rarepepe Going to check this out!
@rarepepe Heritage?
@rarepepe I feel like David Clarke needs to be mayor of a city like Detroit or Baltimore. We need a no-nonsense person like him to be in charge, not another career politician (be it republican or democrat), if we're ever going to fix those cities. #MAGA
@rarepepe I have been programming as a hobby since 16(22 now). I actually do have a few courses purchased on Udemy :) Waiting to go to school to get a degree at least. Not sure if I want to do IT or CS. CS will need more catching up since I was a high school drop out. Just need a kick in the butt!
@rarepepe I said NOT @m 
@rarepepe I want him to be Secretary of Kicking Ass and Taking Names
@rarepepe I will suck your pp and put the spermies in the #BabesOfGAB
@rarepepe It's something we are currently working on but i will tell you this, it's user-first and won't be ad dependent. Content creators and contributors to GAB will have a great time :)
@rarepepe Jehovahs Witness. 
@rarepepe known bug, on the to do list
@rarepepe m/f?
@rarepepe Milo Stewart
@rarepepe Must see photo plz
@rarepepe Oh wow, hashtags are case sensitive here, darn... #BabesofGab
@rarepepe Oh, agreed. I was speaking of a moral *should*, not a practical *could*. Practically, it would be a grand invitation to fraud.
@rarepepe Okay, it's just we get so many people against it you kind of get defensive.
@rarepepe Paper ballot signed by voter would be nice, if their choice could still be concealed. All electronic ballots along with paper, to never get put online. Security to make sure no tampering of electronic devices. yeah would be nice, but not enough time. 
@rarepepe That's why I said "pretty much." Prob the real hard stuff like meth should not be included.  My wife is a psychiatrist and has seen alc abuse take over a person's life quickly, and has had challenges with treating their addiction. In some cases, alc addiction can be as bad as harder drugs.
@rarepepe yes I meant you! 😬 no edit button so I had to go with it 
@Ray_Gatsby That's perfect!
@Razalasd nah not yet. Works well on safari though
@rd Agreed.  It was a great way to engage and follow up with the #GabFam even after it was over.  Yuge response.
@rd Are you actually at the Trump rally in person?
@rd BBC?
@rd Don't know. Hard to be bad ass when you're low energy in a dress. https://sli.mg/wLREDc
@rd Gab a lot about it #TrumpLive
@rd I'd say it is involuntary, yes. Either way I'd prefer is was private. A waste of money if you ask me. That and anything "publicly owned" tends to be inefficient, strangely enough...
@rd I'm for it.
@rd Jeb!
@rd Oh and repost Gabs about it, those count too now #TrumpLive
@rd Oh man, it was amazing.  All the smack the media talked about Trump softening his stances, he knocked the hell outta them.  Powerful speech.  His best one yet and I watch most of his rallies.
@rd One thing that Right Side does though is they cut the sound when copyrighted music plays.  Youtube has removed some of their videos in the past for infringement.  That's the way they work around it.
@rd That's how hotgas.net got started.
@rd The great danger I see is that too many people will keep hyphenating two-word phrases without cause. For example, "human race."
@rd The NHS, for example, is a prime example.
@rd There's a plugin for most browsers that does the same thing called Ghostery.  So "if you like your browser, you can keep your browser." 😁 
@rd They come out now and say he isn't. and both are awful.
@rd This is how.  http://blog.dilbert.com/post/149794681371/trumps-immigration-speech-persuasion-score
@rd Trust me, a lot of it is left-wing, PC drivel. Their reports are incidents like the incident in Cologne were highly skewed. I just hope it gets privatised, then it can be left-wing nonsense without the tax-payer's money to fund it. 
@rd We did it fam! #TrumpLive
@rd which comments sections are you reading mate?  Usually they are shit!
@rdlln cause thatll just break up my parties vote and the opponent will win.
@rdlln i'm with you https://i.sli.mg/BNcl93.jpg
@rdlln naw, not that I know of.
@rdlln true, not to mention the electoral college.
@realDonaldTrump movement won't end at election! "My desire has made me see that I'm willing to fight forever..." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBhE1ArFwUU
@realDonaldTrump_ At least we can agree on the first part. 
@realDonaldTrump_ BWWWAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA, you sound like drone 
@realDonaldTrump_ I can link articles, copies of Clinton emails, point out Wasserman Schultz had to resign, and you will argue the source, no matter how well documented. So I wanted to know if it mattered.
@realDonaldTrump_ I guess that means she is President.
@realDonaldTrump_ I hope not. Honest question. Do you not care about Hillary's corruption, or does it not matter? Not a trick.
@realDonaldTrump_ I humbly ask for your understanding. My lament made you think I was a troll, I truly regret what I said, my hand hovers above the delete of previous posts but I'm too much of a coward to delete that which brings me shame. I trust you are honest and fully honorable. I'm Fake Not you
@realDonaldTrump_ I will as soon as I escape my new prison of shame.  MY NEW PRISON IS SHAME.  https://youtu.be/-unV0m-jZHs?t=15
@realDonaldTrump_ is she still running? How can you tell?
@realDonaldTrump_ Obviously you did, your troll words have forever changed me, my mind was besieged by your intelligent attack, it tried to fend it off but alas it was raped like Nanking. My poor attempt at mockery was seen for what it was and I am ashamed. It will take years of therapy to correct.
@realDonaldTrump_ so edge, much IQ. Wow. 
@realDonaldTrump_ So you are saying if she is corrupt it would matter to you?
@reallyreil welcome to #Gab Dillon! 🐸  The thing you'll be buried by here is love from your #GabFam and potential nudes from Ace_Uncensored 😂   @a made a great video on how to navigate #Gab! You can also check out #GabTips or ask any #GabTeam or #GabFam for help!   http://youtu.be/sxlmq4jktDE
@reallyreil You'd be rolling in dough! What a dumb hag 😀

@Reason4sense Definitely "kinder" just like he was.
@Reason4sense Glad you like it!
@Reason4sense go right ahead
@Reason4sense Goodnight, Phillip, and sleep well.
@Reason4sense I don't think they have an app yet. I've been using the mobile webpage.
@Reason4sense I guess...
@Reason4sense I really miss Art Bell. Hey, someone should see about getting him an invite! (I'm pretty sure he's still alive!) #JohnTitor
@Reason4sense Just goes to show not every bearded religious person is a threat to America
@Reason4sense no. I'd just like to see some celebrities get onboard and plug the platform to their audiences. I really want to see @a succeed. This place is awesome! And more ppl should know about it 👍🏼👍🏽👍🏻😎🇦🇺🇺🇸
@redacted   Wait, is this 2 separate statements or are you telling Jews they are retarded?
@redacted  Always hated the Imperium. If you want to take on the Chaos and to actually win, join da Orkz!
@redacted  I have an irony deficiency.  That's why I take vitamins.
@redacted  It was Ironic? Well fuck, I almost like it.
@redacted  Sorry to hear that.  Hopefully you get to feeling better soon.
@redacted ::This is Nurse: PubID#40935 to clarify. Do you mean my brain (def, never had a limpy like you before) or my client?::

@redacted DELET THIS
@redacted dun do it bro
@redacted Garlic. It's a good general blood cleanser and is excellent for the health of organs that depend on blood to cleanse them and carry away toxins like the liver etc.
@redacted HAHAHAHAHA  So awesome.
@redacted honestly the song about sunscreen? it's true, but also water. drink water everyone, you'll live and be healthy soooo much longer.From what I understand in studies, lowering blood pressure (long distance running/jogging) helps kidneys immensely.
@redacted i am all fired up on rip its. I can't help but carry on
@redacted I quit "Social" media a few years ago because I was too worried I would be tempted to share my opinion and offend people.  Here it is encouraged!  Absolutely love my new #GabFam!
@redacted I think that apples & blueberries are good for kidneys- but I don't think anything tops cranberries. 
@redacted I took this for you today broski because I love my #Gab #GabFam !  #Gabbers #SpeakFreely  https://sli.mg/hbRd3j
@redacted I'm illiterate you shitclown.
@redacted I'm offended, you've done it now. You're in a lot of trouble, buster: https://i.sli.mg/16At29.png #SaySomethingOffensive 
@redacted It burns!  Like salt in a open wound.
@redacted it might help to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections but that's not really kidneys  #NutritionTips
@redacted Just wait till @CarlCuck sees this. Nobody gets offended like my boy cuckin' Carl #OhCarl
@redacted kegels
@redacted kidneys are like trees, they require a lot of water and don't do shit for you, but 20-30 years down the line if you didn't water them, they die... fucking assholes.
@redacted Look more #Salt.  800 followers?!?  Shit I'm still trying to break 60.  
@redacted NOT COOL MAN!!! lol
@redacted Oh I believe in you.  One day my name will be redacted from the internet and i will know the glory.
@redacted Salt, loads and loads of salt.
@redacted Stop hating, fat acceptance and all that..
@redacted that was supposed to be a j and autocorrect on my tablet got me, I cant even pun right 
@redacted the creepy one or the one that does magic tricks out of the back of his black van?

@Reinhardt SO huge, that even working illegals are non-contributors to income tax system, yet reap benefits. PC created the conducive atmosphere by dropping use of "illegal alien"...labels are everything.
@Reinhardt Stupendous!
@Reinhardt Yeah, certainly seems like it.
@Renegade ESPECIALLY don`t try to shove it down anyone`s throat by threatening to chop their heads off if they don`t suck it.
@Renegade https://i.sli.mg/nCYxHk.jpg #SaySomethingOffensive
@Renegade Why do you hate Muslims so much? They just want to hug your child.  Then rape them and put a bomb on them.  Religion of peace! Totally!
@Retro followed :D hope they post more! @hackd
@Retro how about media. How does one post media on #Gab
@Retro I always forget that one!!!
@Retro in the parlance of the region "Friggin' A!"

@riley #NoLivesMatter especially black ones
@riley And it will get reversed, eventually... http://www.mauldineconomics.com/frontlinethoughts/world-gone-backwards Frankly, I hope I live long enough to see it.
@riley Anybody wanna take bets as to how long until the Lapdog Media and/or Leftist puppets at the Southern Poverty Law Center labels GAB as a hate site?
@riley funny thing is, #DNC acted like they agree with you even though they didn't cop to it. Cowards Technically, #BLM isn't a hate group -- their focus is betterment of black lives in the US, they'd only be a hate group if they directed hostility at a group.   http://tinyurl.com/zq9qjkl
@riley I agree, it more like "BlackLiesMatter"
@riley i hope all white people die, starting with donald j trump
@riley Life Of Riley. Sic 'em dawg
@riley That's an hate group that will soon turn into a terrorist group ala hamas if it's not dismanteled quickly.
@riley the Southern Poverty Law Center is a hate group.
@riley Wow, that's a political cluster fuck.  They don't usually just willy nilly add groups to the list.  Usually there's a comprehensive investigation that takes weeks or months.  Them acting that quickly is a sign of their panic about this election cycle.  Watch, that will be HIllary's talking pt
@Riothamus #makeatuneforhillary
@Riothamus @666 @a Can GAB build us bunk beds, so we have room for activities? http://quotesgram.com/step-brothers-quotes-bunk-beds/
@Riothamus DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?!??! HIGH FIVE! 
@Riothamus I support triple bunk beds & smoothie stands. My competitors only support standard bunk beds & black licorice.
@Riothamus I'm here to reintroduce myself in a way I'm finally happy with 😃
@Roark u wot m8
@rob_sterling good stuff 👌 
@RobbinYoung   Ms Young you are an anomaly wrapped in an enigma 
@RobbinYoung #Gab has drawn the more mature intelligent conservative crowd so far.  I've not seen anyone get asked about T & or A.  I expect mass migration from Twtr to Gab to happen in waves...each time Twtr shuts down a conservative account that disagrees with Killary.
@RobbinYoung all these years on twitter, and i'd never connected with you. #gab comes along and fixes that.
@RobbinYoung Amen Sister ! 💚
@RobbinYoung And of course Hillary will have rehearsed the whole debate (a "forum" is for civilised people) with the moderator before. 
@RobbinYoung Don't forget her Middle Eastern Overlords!
@RobbinYoung even her campaign slogan is selfish! 
@RobbinYoung Everyone should like your post just due the words "Dwayne Johnson"  Mmmm he's a very attractive man. You are so lucky!
@RobbinYoung For some reason I'm failing to see how T&A would actually be worked into a conversation about politics and it not involve Bill Clinton. Which just makes it creepy and is best avoided.
@RobbinYoung hey Robin! The #ImWithHillary hashtag is in jest. You are among friends here!!
@RobbinYoung I just want to be somewhere simple. Somewhere small where people keep to themselves and can make a modest income. But I sometimes wonder if that place even exists.
@RobbinYoung I would assume it didn't send but . . . I just read it your message . . . I am easily confused, so  . . . it could mean a variety of things. Hope that helps ;)
@RobbinYoung I'd probably do it but nobody will pay me. :(
@RobbinYoung I'm not familiar with Twitter but glad to have you on #GAB #MAGA 
@RobbinYoung If you are looking at your notifications, the time stamp will be at the beginning of your notification.  If you are looking at your main feed (or someone's profile) the timestamp will be located in the lower right-hand corner of the Gab.  Clicking on the timestamp opens it.  #GabTips
@RobbinYoung If you censor me I will call the goddamn cops.
@RobbinYoung if you need any help, please ask. #GabFam 
@RobbinYoung Nice😉👍
@RobbinYoung no problem, cable would spin most of it anyway  :)
@RobbinYoung Post tits, bitch. 
@RobbinYoung Right now, the #GabFam is mostly comprised of people who have finally found a platform where we can be funny and make sarcastic remarks about society, but we're constantly growing so it won't be all jokes when #Gab matures. (It's in beta testing now.) We hope you'll stay and enjoy!!
@RobbinYoung Robbin, what are you sick *with* ?  (since you brought it up)  (if I am not prying) (Maybe someone here on #Gab can help)
@RobbinYoung show me your pussy, fatty
@RobbinYoung Standing in line at the store this morning, I glanced at the cover of one of those supermarket tabloids with a headline that said, "I sold Matt Lauer cocaine."  Yep, he's a Clinton stooge since he meets that minimum requirement standard.
@RobbinYoung Telling it exactly like it is.  That's why the Trump Ladies are the best.
@RobbinYoung thank you for moving to gab.ai and not supporting censorship policies on other sites who have fought so hard against PIPA censorship in 2012 but now censor people who don't agree with their highest officials (jack).
@RobbinYoung The arrows next to the post. Up is like down is dislike I just click up on everything personally. #OhCarl
@RobbinYoung The best way to track your conversations either in notifications or your feed is to click the timestamps.  That will open that thread for you to engage.
@RobbinYoung WE LOVE OUR TRUMP LADIES!
@RobbinYoung Would Harambe have been a kinder storm or far more powerful ?

@Roberto ahh! Thanks! 😘
@Roberto Humans have been modifying & enhancing appearances for thousands of years for myriad reasons. My only issue is with elective medical procedures being politicized and funded by taxpayers.
@Roberto I forgot to mention... Our mental healthcare system sucks ass!
@Roberto I think I understand. However, if a woman feels less attractive among her peers gets her boobs enlarged, does her low self-esteem qualify as a mental health disorder? No procedure is 100% safe. Also, defining mental illness is complicated and evolving.
@Roberto It could be argued that a person identifying as the opposite sex and loves that side wants the external to match their perception. #SaySomethingOffensive
@Roberto Then all cosmetic surgery (the procedures that have no health benefit), such as breast augmentation unrelated to cancer, could be lumped in there.

@rose I want to think I'm part of it.  Like that would make me happy.  But I'm not really sure I am.  That makes me sad.  lol.  Now I'm just rambling.  umm....ok....you're hot. *runs away*
@rose i'm getting strange looks and sounds from 9yr old. but he's distracted by his tablet. 
@rose I'm not involved and I'm an involuntary observer, you guys need to get a room!
@rose I'm surprised they don't have the training at your local Jehova Witness Kingdom Hall  "Good afternoon,   Do you have a moment to tak about our lord and savior Donald Trump?"  #MAGA
@rose I've always preferred to be behind the camera. This might take me a while to get up my nerve.
@rose I've called him a beardless crypto-jew. I'll see if he responds.
@rose If I'm commenting to say I don't think I'm part of it, does that now make me part of it?
@rose It makes us men 657% more attracted to you, also. Something about that glow it gives you...
@rose It was a'ight. I wanna get in on those shouting matches they're planning though, yelling at lefties sounds fun.
@rose It's not that exclusive, they let me in for about 10 seconds. From what I understand they just like to sail. #TheBand
@rose just whole wheels of cheese stacked atop eachother
@rose love octopod?
@rose Make sure you get the full version. Ya know, the one with like 5 minutes of non-music exposition.
@rose Marry me
@rose mmmm, tears.
@rose my little brother does that, i'll have to steal some of his grapes for a taste!
@rose Nice! The rose looks really realistic 😃 
@rose No contest there.  Better personalities too
@rose no. still upset over the whole redcoats thing. make them grovel.
@rose Noice. Did you wave?
@rose not exclusive at all, we promote all #GabFam to join in the shitposting, under a hashtag, get to meet new people on a micro level.  #TheBand  OG
@rose not much just amaze day Gab, yoyoyo
@rose Nothing much, Rdog. Just filing my memes. What about you? 
@rose nothing. just wondering what I'll do with my life. I could go down the Computer Science route or become a Politician and maybe, just maybe become Prime Minister.
@rose Oh don't you tease me.  Packing tonight!!
@rose Oh I think it's will be easy. Lets get to work!  
@rose Only if they're LEGAL.
@rose Ooh! First Gab wedding soon?
@rose Pure cheese. https://i.sli.mg/cmMK70.png this one for instance.  I mean, there can be OTHER desserts but a cheese wedding cake is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
@rose scientifically proven! https://sli.mg/ku56F3  #WomenOfGab
@rose so since your taken now can you put in a good word for me with your twin @themotherface?  
@rose So your parents support Trump? Lucky, my mom gets all red-faced whenever I'm watching a Trump speech and starts screeching about how I 'joined a cult' And my dad makes jokes to anyone we're with about 'how bad my son's politics are' 
@rose Someday... #IWillSuckYourPPOrVaginaForFollows
@rose sup homie
@rose Sweeeeet.
@rose That is awesome. So happy for you. Can't wait to see a picture of him.   God I love dogs. 
@rose That would be the only logical explanation.
@rose that's awesome. I too am trying to adopt a dog. What kind of dog you thinking of getting?
@rose That's what's happening with me. Wanted a small Nordic raven now I'm thinking of a whole sleeve. 
@rose The Lone Bellow, Of Monsters and Men, Sebadoh, Lord Huron, Pixies, Pavement and Sigur Ros.
@rose There goes my #FreedomBoner
@rose those eyes! 
@rose though my heart is broken. Happiness to you two.  @Futhington
@rose Tight. Keep chilling and I'll catch ya in the next yo-yo. 
@rose Training and the Republican Party are mutually exclusive concepts 😁 
@rose Two *StupidBlindfucking* Uncles   Fixed! 
@rose Umm no. I'm super jealous. I thought we had a fun weird stalking thing going on. #crushed. 
@rose Waddup

@rose Who?
@rose Wish I knew how to attach a pic but here I am!
@rose Wouldn't happen if I was in town, let me tell you. Wew!
@rose wow! Hello nurse 😮
@rose Yep yep.  More cost more.
@rose yo yo
@rose yo yo yo.
@rose yo, home skillet!
@rose you know just on that gab grind, where you from?
@rose You sure you don't live in the gay quarter? A friend of mine once went out looking to pull in my town one evening and didn't realize she was in Birmingham's gay district...
@rose you're 18 lol. 
@rose you're doing the God Emporer's work patriot. Carry on.
@rose Your so cute and badass at the same time 😉
@rose Your tattoos are awesome! How many do you have? (If you don't mind me asking)
@rose Your very welcome, I wish I had more space on my profile to add people, but u are definitely worth a follow and a shout out
@rose yoyo
@rose 😆🤘
@rose 😍😍😍😍
@RothbardianSlip minority coercion over the majority is also coercion.  Coercion is inevitable without willfull consensus.  The fasces represents the republics right to coerce.
@Royal_Tenenbaum Call Lawyer, delete Facebook, hit the gym #GabFam
@ryan Works on Chrome too for android users. Just hit the three dots. 
@ryan 👌👆👍
@sa Congrats. #WomenOfGab have got smarts and guts. Can't fail.
@sa get that black cock out of your throat then. 
@sa gotcha fam http://www.redbubble.com/people/gabai/portfolio?ref=carousel_portfolio
@sa I feel this on a spiritual level.
@sa I like to believe it is because any inkling of reality that gets too close threatens to burst their fantasy bubbles.
@sa I LOVE that every time I make a change, people notice before I announce 😂 
@sa I went Android instead of Nokia, a good move.
@sa is making a career change. @SMOKeMON has a cat hidden in his profile picture. I think. @Jim is fucking ungrateful. @regular_citizen is just okay with stuff other than music and art. @Pete is right about Tila Tequila. 
@sa it's not as bad as it seems tbh
@sa Kate
@sa lack of vocabulary. 
@sa lolz
@sa One time I got a fortune cookie fortune that said, "Life is a comedy for those who think, and a tragedy for those who feel."  So I think it's like that.
@sa thank
@sa that sucks. I really need to censor that #100followers copy pasta lol
@sa That's one huge advantage to the chromebook, a restart does the update, take 30 seconds.
@sa The Nokias are good phones, Microsoft let them down.
@sa They're afraid of people hearing a different narrative and realising what they've been pumped with since grade school is complete rubbish. 
@sa they're cucks. 
@sa Tutoring is a great experience... When the participant is willing. Just always give an earnest & honest effort and you'll do great!
@sa yep, look what they did to nokia. When I can afford it I want a new Chromebook with 4gb of ram, it should fly.
@sa You've described my mom pretty well there. I even made fun of her for it once. Like, to her face, and not in the shower an hour later
@Safire_four I'll be honest mate, that sounds like the dream
@sakuramboo can you share a screenshot?
@Sal_Ritchie   I flipped through my SJW handbook, and it's definitely "race and sex." :)
@Sal_Ritchie  Huh, didn't know that  You learn something new everyday 
@Sal_Ritchie Abolutely! Go for it....
@Sal_Ritchie And didn't they look great? Like they wanted to be there together... Two dudes on a mission. #MAGA
@Sal_Ritchie eg. these guys convicted in SA recently. They were previously involved in constant "bad behaviour";stuff that "god doesnt like", such as drugs, fucking around, partying, fighting etc. But suddenly became reborn Muslims. Converted by Jihadis via subtle guilt-tripping/sin-shaming
@Sal_Ritchie exactly! Those two need to shag and get it over with, once and for all!!
@Sal_Ritchie Fucky Fucky long time😉😳
@Sal_Ritchie haha
@Sal_Ritchie I am honestly so out of touch with what is happening down there that I had no idea about this little nugget
@Sal_Ritchie I am seriously pissed at him for making us sound like a bunch of fucking robots! This is all a bloody game for them, labeling people that have serious concerns for the future of this bloody world! It's not a fucking game!!!
@Sal_Ritchie I'm Canadian. But I would love to see what ensues if a citizen's arrest on Hillary. 
@Sal_Ritchie Me neither! Have a chat to @nutbunny Got all the info on what is happening on the ground in SA.
@Sal_Ritchie No, nothing like that. Muslim community is generally static in size. It's just that recently we've been getting more Sudanese, Somali, Egyptians, Ethiopians fleeing conflict, and with them comes Jihadis, like ticks hitching a ride. Local Muslims want nothing to do with them; bad eggs.
@Sal_Ritchie Sure. We can see some polar bears and drink some syrup.
@Sal_Ritchie the goal of jihadis is to get people to believe theyd be doing good by joining them. Since they wear the Islamic brand, theyre going to attempt to use that religfious connection to try to convince people. They are thugs & so interact with society initially via the criminal element.
@Sal_Ritchie They behave in a similar vein as the usual orthodox religious teachers in mannerisms etc, to portray an air of righteousness. They target criminals/gangsters, working on their closeted guilt, convincing them that this is a form of salvation from their usual sinful acitivities
@Sal_Ritchie wait  YouTube made Drudge? That's new to me.  Did Matt Drudge have a YouTube account and got suspended? Then he made the Drudge Report?   IDK lol
@Sal_Ritchie Watched it too. The lads have chemistry, though. That much you could tell. Trump is the boss - Nieto needs all the help he can get keeping votes and money pouring in, lid on the cartels... A good US-leaning relationship will come of this.
@Sal_Ritchie We see that sort of middleEastern zealotry as ugly and indecent. We local Muslims like wearing normal western clothing, and doing our 9to5 jobs, and spending time at malls and watching TV and partying and listening to music. Our worship is still there but theres no compulsion/oppression
@Sal_Ritchie What I guess I'm trying to say is that these foreign muslims bring with them a very unpalatable dialect of Islam with them from their fucked up parts of the world. Forced burka wearing, FGM, and conflict addicted Jihadis. Us local Muslims dont appreciate that sorta oppressive shit
@Sal_Ritchie Yes this is why the normalMuslim population in SA hasnt botherd interactingmuch with these foreignJihadis, because the Jihadis r part&parcel of criminalElement. SA Muslims dont have any drivingforce 2b radicalised like those inEurope who r predominantly from countries producing Jihadis
@Sam eating is a social experience  If your diet is so restricted you can't have fun once in a while, its not worth it. If what you can/can't eat stops you enjoying dinner with friends, you should be reassessing your priorities  #NutritionTips
@SardonicTears all of the are staples of #TheBnad  OG 
@SardonicTears those ppl dying of famine in places with plenty of air and sunlight ought to hurry up and adapt, then. 
@Sat It's a shame 'cause the /lit/ boards have plenty of fairly talented writers. It's just that they don't have the confidence to put their stuff out there, beyond the confines of their own little userbase.
@Schultz_Brigade Which of the 3 games are you talking about :P
@scotters @wocassity I do!
@scotters all of them
@scotters excellent! Let's get them #Triggersoutforkillery
@scotters its a big gap they need to fix
@scotters Mine have their mother's genes, if it goes quiet it's time to start tossing the room like a prison cell knowing that in the long run, they have probably pulled an Andy Dufresne on us.
@scotters T my house when the youngin's were little they'd be relieved that it wasn't squirrel again.
@scotters That laziest photo shop ever 😂 😂😂😂😂😂
@scotters That's the problem. There are just so many #BabesofGab that the list would be never-ending.   But if someone has to document them all I volunteer. I'll probably get @rose to help. She is pretty ducking awesome. 
@scotters They are hiding sugar or something is burning...
@scotters They're plotting something!
@scotters. Damnit autocorrect. @rose is fucking awesome. She is not a duck as far as I know. But with all these genders who knows anymore. 
@seanbrown The Clinton News Network and the other dishonest media outlets are in panic mode attempting to reshape the narrative because they know it will bring more indie voters to his side.  They are trying to mitigate their losses and people are seeing through the desperate spin panic.
@Sebacore  There's a few hotties in the crowds for sure, but they're probably dead on the inside.  The majority look like poster children for meth or diabetes. 
@Sebacore #Hillary Mask, you say?  https://i.sli.mg/yRPvWh.jpg
@Sebacore @michellejoz
@Sebacore Agreed.  They are SJW commies.  At least one of those people are the main reason Ozzy fried his brains on bath salts.
@Sebacore Aww, baby steps! Take your time. If you rush, you'd find it a chore. But I'm always up for a good conversation, so feel free to hit me up anytime :)
@Sebacore Ban bossy can be improved, but I see no need to "ban" the word. Just highlight the stereotype by showing girls that they're not bossy, just assertive, and they can use it to their advantage? Once they start doing that, the negative connotation with the word will disappear. 
@Sebacore Banning does fuck all but improve something, especially if it's language. People will then use it out of spite. Blows things out of proportion unnecessarily, if you ask me.
@Sebacore Exactly I've been stunned by the whole thing.
@Sebacore feels good man 
@Sebacore gucking...
@Sebacore hahaha thanks. 
@Sebacore https://media3.giphy.com/media/qivbcSpS2mdAA/giphy.gif
@Sebacore I agree. Like I said, there are some things that we cannot do. I think "strength" thing mostly applies to instances where self-improvement can give you a fair assessment where "competition" is concerned. 
@Sebacore I believe in you, and if you don't believe in you believe in the me that believes and you, and the Trump that believes in the American People
@Sebacore I thought so too, but I have failed every "America's Got Talent" audition.
@Sebacore I'd go with #HotWomenOfGab myself
@sebacore idk that's why I had to use a 💋, in partially French so it's okay. I'm not just "white" 😂
@Sebacore It'll happen, upvote posts follow other people, you'll soon hit 100 and go further.
@Sebacore Me toooo.
@Sebacore Secret truth.  I braid my nose hair.
@Sebacore thanks 💋 @rose is a total babe, tru that
@Sebacore Thanks 💕💕💕😉
@Sebacore thanks! Much appreciated😘
@Sebacore That would then depend on the cultural context. In a lot of cases, this is justified by the local culture and reinforced by religion. 
@Sebacore That's how I felt when @kellymarie said no to my buddy and I! :'(
@Sebacore That's okay too, I haven't put a cross except anything other than #Brexit in over a decade, I spoil my ballot.
@Sebacore That's okay.
@Sebacore The music in it's own right is bad enough- but goddamn- have you ever seen the shit that goes on at their gatherings?  It's so depraved that they're actually studied by legit science.  The only good thing that has come from ICP's existence is that Glade commercial.
@Sebacore Throw like a girl/ boy is sending the wrong message because it implies that one gender is better than the other, which isn't true. We have our strengths and weaknesses so we shouldn't use our biological sex as a precursor/ stereotype.
@Sebacore too real?
@Sebacore Uh, you forgot me.
@Sebacore Usually I'd see the context. I think campaigns like those are more needed where I'm from, where societies are still highly patriarchal. Ban bossy seems reasonable, but throw like a girl seems to be sending the wrong message.  
@Sebacore we are better than the Bernie girls for sure 
@Sebacore Well, if you mean stuff like childbirth, yes, that's what we're built for. But if it's something where you can train to improve yourself at, it no longer applies. 
@Sebacore You forgot lauren southern
@Sebacore you're totally right! Some gorgeous ladies here in the #GabFam  https://66.media.tumblr.com/67745fa729fac5a30078b2340fe90366/tumblr_nigp51bXMe1ql5yr7o1_500.gif 
@Sebacore 😃 hey thanks!
@Sentinel #BuildtheWall #10ftHigher
@Sentinel Because they're....idiots? #MAGA #Trump #GabFam
@Sentinel Certainly didn't hear the Media upset about the 40 Billion to the 51st State, (((Israel)))  http://goo.gl/KvBrWz
@Sentinel I'll bet they can save a lot just by using volunteer labor. lol 
@Sentinel It's the same argument people made about Bernie's ~8 billion dollar college assistance. Compared to the shit we shouldn't be spending money on but totally are, it's basically nothing. Heck, Hillary almost lost that much money on her own
@Sentinel LOLOL, Guac Bowl Merchant and Foam Boi? Oh come on now!!! Ha ha ha ha!!! #Trump #MAGA #TrumpLive
@Sentinel Right? Bush and Obama spent 15 years hosing down the Middle East with American blood and treasure, but $12B is all of a sudden outrageous. 
@Sentinel they built a financial empire on mistaking our apathy for stupidity.  Im surprised they lasted this long
@Sentinel When people bring this up just show that illegals cost $113 billion a year.  Even if we paid for it (estimated $20 billion tops) the wall pays for itself in less than a year. http://www.fairus.org/publications/the-fiscal-burden-of-illegal-immigration-on-united-states-taxpayers
@Serendipitea calcium in them is beneficial + they tend to be fortified with other vits and minerals   Ask a dietician I dont read research on preggers specific diets
@Serendipitea I love it too, reminds me of when my grandpa built hotels. He earned millions, we'd eat at Waffle House and KFC all the time. 😀 we loved it! 
@Serendipitea just told me #hashtags are also #gabtags. Ha. Smart! I like it. Um, @RadaLuvvie is an image of perfection. I don't think I shoutout @mf enough, that's a good guy to follow because he explains things. @redacted is funny as shit, I'd follow them twice if I could. 
@Serendipitea little evidence behind probiotics  High dose vitamin c might reduce length of colds by a few hours but do nothing to reduce symptom severity   Most women have inadequate iron in their diets  #NutritionTips
@Serendipitea me too!! I hope I'm not leaving anyone out, I have a good memory but it's short :/ 
@Serendipitea placebo effect is magic, isn't it?
@Serendipitea Saw on a livestream yesterday some cuck asking why Trump wants to separate hard-working contributing families. My question was: How are they contributing if they're illegal? No taxes, taking government subsidies, using our roads, etc. In addition to their children using our schools.
@Serendipitea Well said!! #TrumpLive
@Serendipitea Yes, I love America and want to put America First! I want strong borders and someone to enforce the law. I want our vets taken care of. I want Americans taken care of first, before illegals or refugees. I want a strong military too. I'm also tired of all the PC language. #Trump #MAGA

@ShannonMontague I remember back in the day you got a service pack and that was it. None of these continuous updates. 
@ShannonMontague I switched years ago to mac partly because of the obnoxious updates.  A co-worker of mine on a Windows computer went through that same scenario about every month "my computer broke!  Oh wait, no it's not"
@ShannonMontague I tried and it didn't let me 🍕🐸
@shannonmontague I was about to lecture him for kissing your as because you're more than a pretty face. I suppose he knows that since you're married. 😂🤐 muh bad

@Sharksheep welcome to #GAB Cyril! 👋🇺🇸🐸   Seriously love the name "Sharksheep" 😆   @a made a great quick-start video on how to navigate #Gab! Also check out #GabTips! If you have any questions, ask any of your #GabFam! 🐸  http://youtu.be/sxlmq4jktDE
@shell Hillary looks like a shambling corpse compared to this radiant orange beauty 👀 
@shell I believe the exit code is 60, in which case it's an SSL cert error.
@shell running curl -k /--insecure pops HTTP unauthorized 401s
@shell thanks for the follow.
@shell yeah was working on that, still getting a local cert issue, tried many different fixes, same error. bleh. but it happens on any ssl connection. gonna just give up for a bit and maybe retackle in a few hours.
@Sheppard_Gabriel not even communists
@Shiyya27 Now there's a VP you can get behind.
@shorty   >>  the vast majority of them between young girls and  >> older men  Just an observation, but the only reasonable alternative to the stated pairing I can come up with is "young boys and older women," which I don't think I've *ever* heard of. Is such a thing even possible?  And in Germany!?
@shorty  #NutritionTips  Many processed foods contain a lot of additional ingredients that may/ may not improve your health.   Safest bet to reduce sugar intake is to make your own meals.
@shorty  yeah :(
@shorty #Alt-Sugar is a thing now? Damn you, Putin!
@shorty #AusFam is down well 😜 
@shorty #Coffee can never be too strong or too thick.
@shorty #NotAllCarbs?  i don't think i understand.  :/
@shorty #NutritionTips   Follow up. Let's assume I am retarded and ignore your incredibly reasonable and sensible drinking advice. How do I take care of my hangover?
@shorty 138 were registered in Holland last year, that's those they know of. the rest???
@shorty @shorty  I've looked into the evidence for benefits of fish oil, and yeah you're right. It's murky. I may just stick to eating actual fish and other sources for omegas.   Have you ever heard of Dr. Rhonda Patrick? She is usually my go to for nutrition info. Highly recommend her work 
@shorty a lack of will
@shorty a picture or two for you... Just for yo thug/gangsta cred  https://i.sli.mg/Ig11SI.jpg  https://i.sli.mg/Pymr0U.jpg
@shorty absolute madman
@shorty ah. TY #BritFam  😊
@shorty Also, wanted to bug you at some time for any other diet suggestions, though I'll wait for DM's before gumming up your TL.  As for progress, lost two pants sizes and about 12kg in 6 weeks so far.
@shorty and cheese, don`t forget fine French or Belgian cheeses.
@shorty any cutting edge nutrition blogs or researchers you follow? #NutritionTips
@shorty Any thoughts on Stevia? Not artificial and sweeter than sugar so you can use less of it. Don't know much about it outside of that tho.
@shorty Any thoughts though? I swear I won't take them to heart and do anything silly
@shorty anyone #NutritionTips? 🙂 
@shorty are you familiar with Dr. Rhonda Patrick? She's got a great technical podcast.
@shorty at least those outside the Home Counties voted #Brexit.  I shouldn't have a go!
@shorty avoid the prostitutes ...  Most liberal tourists have infected them already 
@shorty Been there, done that, whipped your butt, got the T-shirt, flag and #Freedom to prove it. MAGBA? #NoThanks
@shorty But how short are you really?
@shorty but it's Oop Nyorth
@shorty But you can #FarageTheMirage
@shorty Can attest - as a current pudgy working hard to whittle down the weight, it was only once I started moving AND eating right (and cutting the IT diet of Red Bull and McDonald's) that the results started becoming more evident.
@shorty can confirm sugar free mixtures = win.
@shorty Can't wait for the mobile app! 😀 
@shorty Carbs aren't just OK, they are needed for your brain to function!
@shorty check my timeline, there are guns posted for you to brag on.
@shorty Cheddar, Gloucester, Double Gloucester, Stilton, Red Leicester, Wensleydale, Caerphilly, Lancashire, Derby, Yarg, Cornish Brie, Y Fenni, Windsor... the list is endless. God's own country for cheese. #BritFam #SuperiorCheeses
@shorty ever person I've talked to has basically said cranberry in high dosage helps the kidneys do their job easier so they get more time to rest, idk though, I'm a spy, not a doctor.
@shorty excellent! Will do the same😘
@shorty General health improved and my sleep apnoea improved when I started cooking my own meal.  The better the quality of ingredients, the more I started feeling a change.  Ronald McDonald is a murderer.
@shorty God damn, that much pastry can kill a man surely?
@shorty Goddamnit, now you're pissing me off.  I haven't seen a cheesemonger, ironmonger, or had a proper Yorkshire pudding or lamb and mint in ages.
@shorty good to know, they are quite expensive!
@shorty Great looking blog! Will get into that later. I also have blogs, but not ready to share those yet. x 
@shorty haha #NotAllCarbs, well done.  #NutritionTips
@shorty haha lololol [snort]
@shorty Hello shorty the shitposting therapist. Ty for making my feed interesting overnight 😀 
@shorty Here's what I put in my coffee https://www.onnit.com/emulsified-mct-oil/ 
@shorty http://flowjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/science-bitche-png.png
@shorty I didn't know until recently that Splenda is actually made from sugar... It's just not "supposed" to be processed in the body like sugar. Not everyone is the same and there have been cases where people's blood sugar levels have risen from it
@shorty I drink nato standard with milk and sugar :-P
@shorty I find studies that focus on gut flora by region to be interesting! but being a unlearned peasant can only get you so far.
@shorty I guess it does, haha. I'm reading through your link now.
@shorty I have half a block of English Coastal cheddar cheese in my fridge that can attest to that.   American cheese looks and tastes like plastic. 
@shorty I look forward to it, those two both work with steel BBs, a bit of fun no more. The handgun is 80% of the real thing though.
@shorty I really do understand what you're saying though, and I feel the same about the people that go on about alternative medicine.
@shorty I think the intermittent fasting proponents assume great nutritional habits are a given
@shorty I think you need to be aware, you have to let Truth trickle in like a hamster water feeder. If you release it like a dam plebs will run and never come back.
@shorty I use IF myself (along w/ low carb diet), and I've found it to be quite effective in maintaining my weight loss. Experiment on yourself and see how you feel, and check the scale. If you are interested in journals, go look yourself. I'm not claiming to be a doctor. Are you?
@shorty I went from decades of drinking 6 sodas a day to none by snacking on grapes to replace the sugars so I wouldn't go all hillary and fizzle out
@shorty I would hope that someone who is trying to improve their health using intermittent fasting would also be critical of the food they are eating. "Not eating for a day" is not what I'm talking about. Check this out: https://www.onnit.com/academy/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/
@shorty I'm snacking on carrots as I type. 
@shorty I've gone from cheeseburgers five days a week to only three. I think it's definitely making a difference. 
@shorty I've got a weightlifting/trainer Facebook friend that's been going on and on about ketones or whatever it is since he discovered it---think he's even selling it now.  Just had broccoli, rice, with coconut oil and lemon for lunch! Gotta practice my lentil game.
@shorty If they're using mobile, when they hit the back button from a page they follow from yours, it unfollows you. Could be just a mistake that I've made in my #GabFam infancy... @support I know you're super busy but it may be something you can look into when you do your next updates. 
@shorty incredibly this! The amount of new-ageism they apply into nutrition is pure quackery. and people believe them because they get a degree in the U.S. and get sick/hurt. When in reality moderation(for the most part obviously you need some balance) is key and exercise.
@shorty Indeed. But the mistaken idea that one can simply diet, not change their activity levels in any meaningful way and expect results is a sad one. 
@shorty Is there any benefit to cutting out carbs completely? #NutritionTips
@shorty It is if you use Time Lord tech.
@shorty It's crap, though I probably wouldn't have a handgun anyway, I'd prefer one of the current M-4 variants.
@shorty It's not bad for up here...
@shorty jesus you are pretty fucking nutritionally based...
@shorty jesus! 🙁 
@shorty less interesting than I hoped but makes sense.
@shorty Many thanks, Professor! <3  #NutritionTips
@shorty My daughter is a vegetarian. I keep telling her she needs to eat more protein to avoid getting hungry through the day. Am I right?  *probs not!  #NutritionTips
@shorty Never had it. There's like a million blue cheeses though and they're all godly.
@shorty No need to be bitter
@shorty Not a chance! 
@shorty not in America, am in europe :)  Most people are fat or anorexic. There's very little middle of the road people. Eastern europe different tho
@shorty Not sorry that I will bend my knee to no one except the Lord my GOD and not even Kate is He.   hillclintOOn may try as she may to ruin America but we won' tolerate much. America is waking up to bad leadership's lies and we're tired of it! 
@shorty oh right I thought you were still referring to York.  As you will see I know my geography
@shorty Oh shit.. Claire Bear.. m'lady 
@shorty Oh well time to revert to my instincts
@shorty oi m8 moka pots are the literal tits, and i'm even using a caveman electric stovetop #tryhardpleb 
@shorty Okay. What are your thoughts on keto?
@shorty other than cranberry, are there any foods especially good for kidneys. Serious question.
@shorty People eat microwave pizza inside cakes? HOLY FUCKING SHIT I MUST HAVE THIS!!!  Where's the nearest Hardees?
@shorty Preston isn't much better :(
@shorty Right, this was the big issue with #Soylent users if it was used as a chance to pull away from people. That and jaw problems.   Eating and Drinking with friends and kin is one of the primal and eternal pleasures of mankind.
@shorty salt of the earth
@shorty she's batshit crazy, who could want this bitch in power #$hillary 
@shorty Shitposting doesn't sound very nutritious, though. #justsaying
@shorty So basically my entire diet is going to kill me?
@shorty studies in the UK must be leagues better than U.S. known quite a few uni trained "Nutritionists" that support 7-10 day cleanses. It's crazy...
@shorty Sugar ( fructose )  is like alcohol without the buzz. 
@shorty Thanks Claire!
@shorty thanks! Are probiotic drinks worth having every day for general wellbeing?
@shorty that explains it! I was like wow not a fucking nutto on probiotics! whereas it -may- possibly be good for those who use ingestible antibiotics for the most part it is a marketing scam
@shorty That guy is my hero (after #Trump of course)
@shorty That is 1 place I would still like to visit.
@shorty That's very kind of you to be giving professional advice for free. I hope someone here can benefit from it.
@shorty The #tinfoilhat inside of me wants to bet Bill Clinton wont be alive by the end of the election. #$hilary the slimy bitch will have him offed and blamed on #rightwing violence. Far fetched maybe, but she's done worst!
@shorty The article is talking about how it is not a good idea for use in cooking, because of it's high fat content. I'm following a high fat, low carb diet, and am only consuming 1 tablespoon in the morning. I notice a difference, but maybe it's the taste. I usually drink my coffee black.
@shorty The Farage is powerful medicine. Did you see him speak at a Trump rally? 
@shorty The sheer lies of globalists stating they care for immigrants, when really they just toss them on citizens hand them a check and let them go wild. Bastard journalists refusing to write the truth to warn others about the sheer lunacy of it all in hopes of getting govt money...
@shorty The study I saw on fish oil said they found none, this study says they found some.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15055244
@shorty there are pills for that. I don't hate vegans they're fitter than 90% of standard American People with Standard American Diet. 
@shorty there better be some "bangers in the mouth" in that blog
@shorty There have been studies done that show the benefits of fish oil.   http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/omega3-fatty-acids
@shorty They have a whole selection of cheese wedding cakes...  Yo @rose can we?
@shorty This is something that annoys me in the field of nutrition. Everyone's an expert with little evidence. Pubmed is required. 
@shorty thoughts on sugar substitutes? I've heard they are bad as well and try to stay away from them 
@shorty Thy will be done, beautiful #BritFam Queen. Thy will be done.
@shorty TitsorGTFO 
@shorty wait so...I can't have my 230am plate of chicken tendies?
@shorty We cook with Cast Iron as much as possible. Supposed to help add iron. Lasts for generations, saves water, saves detergent and once they're good and seasoned, saves fat usage bc it's non stick.
@shorty we have the best shitty bloggers on #Gab 
@shorty we like Adele and FranOcean rn  The queer band Pwr Bttm is also my fucking life 
@shorty We need to construct a border. A beautiful Bacon Border. And the Saudis should pay for the border. 100%
@shorty We only use them because they work for us...but as needed, not every day. Good to have a #GabNutritionist here! #Gabfam
@shorty We use pro-biotics as needed for digestive (refrig kind) and first sign of cold/flu, we start EmergenC powder packets for few days. I have to take iron. #buttingintoconvo
@shorty Welcome to my world, where people ignore the science behind e-cigs that I pore over, and they listen to people who abuse the hell out of them and then say they are as dangerous as cigarettes..
@shorty well this wouldn't be the first time authority figures have lied to me, darn you doctor type people
@shorty Well, maybe. I dunno. My certified midwife recommended probiotics during pregnancy, I found them helpful. 
@Shorty what do you suggest you drink to make you love me more? 💋😍🙌
@Shorty What foods/drinks are best to cleanse and maintain liver health?  Other than not drinking lol. #NutritionTips
@shorty What idiot Political Correctness looks like.
@shorty What would happen if one were to consume a litre of olive oil?
@shorty what's good to encourage hair growth/strength?
@shorty When I was a child, I had a #hamster that I named Mr. Grimsby.
@shorty Whoohoo!
@shorty wow those #NutritionTips really took off 👌 
@shorty XX 
@shorty yeah! Our doctors are pretty damn good! Pitty they are all in the UK and Auz now (well most of them anyway)
@shorty Yeah! We've started the blog postings!! 
@shorty Yeah, I'm just trying to optimize my training. I just know how I'm feeling when I make a change. Thanks for pointing that out, I was following the advice of my gym friend. So it's a lot of Bro Science. #NutritionTips
@shorty Yes... #CtrlLeft are beyond ridiculous... It really is a mental disorder
@shorty you mean Boerewors! Hahaha and good wine and the first EVER heart transplant 
@shorty You tell 'em Claire!
@shorty Your GAB is pretty much an awesome, literary blog.
@shorty Yup, If you can't pronounce most of the ingredients, it's probably not that good for you. Ever since watching Food Inc, we've got a running joke around here; Everything's got corn in it. (or something chemically extracted from it) Dextrose, HFCS etc. Most animal feed contains lots of corn 2
@shorty Yup. But as more people join, the * gets more and more crowded  (and it isn't just newbies)
@shorty 😂😂😂😂😂🐸🐸🐸🐸 they know their son is a master troll by now I don't think we fooled them this time. 
@shorty 😃
@shropshirelad 's book got me thinking #GabQueers, where's the most interesting place you've sucked some D?  mine: funeral home.   i'd suck a cock on mars,  suck cock in bars suck cock in the back of cars 😂 
@shropshirelad hell yea man, whats your # 😃 
@shropshirelad I think that's probably accurate, yeah. 
@shropshirelad i wasn't man! added to my wish list, was being cheeky, i honestly expected noods tho lol 😬 
@shropshirelad I work for myself, so it would be impossible for me to lose "my job".  They could doxx me and file bogus charges to get my kids taken away though.  I had that happen to a friend.  So my approach is to embed my speech within my writing and invite all to come and read it.
@shropshirelad If I had the technical skill, I'd put together a free speech based publication.  I follow Vox Day on twatter and seen him on FreeDomain Radio sometimes.  I know he has a publishing house for novels, not sure about articles though.
@shropshirelad Keep me updated and I will help promote it.  I can write a blog post about it and use my social media accounts.  It may not do much, but every little bit adds up.
@shropshirelad Wew, lad! #GabQueers are the best queers
@shropshirelad What type of articles do you write that you want to publish?  I can see your novels in your descript, so can I assume your articles are related?  This is an opportunity to find other writers in the same bind and create an indie publication to spread these messages.
@sjdgls @TH Before I got to the #Coffee tag I thought you were discussing bourbon.
@sjdgls I don't dream about it, I drink and inhale it
@sjdgls lol. You trying to pimp me out?? 😂
@sjdgls No vaping, I vape brazilian coffee flavour liquid
@sjdgls not bovvered at ALL. I'm used to being the 'fat friend'* 😭  *disclaimer: I'm not really fat.

@slowdowngandhi  Here's a National Public Radio announcer covering the immigration speech last night: https://i.sli.mg/xIpdig.gif 
@slowdowngandhi #TheBestThingAboutTrump to me is that he makes so many heads explode! I just can't believe #Trump's actually been successful in getting the country's attention where so many others have failed. #MAGA #BurnTheVillageToSaveIt 
@slowdowngandhi @uhohkeelysawake Only by the individual user is there any moderation. That and TOS violations, which are things that are illegal by themselves, threats, illegal porn, etc. Politics and instilling butthurt are not TOS violations.
@slowdowngandhi anyone willing to join a #FreeSpeech platform? probably no. If they were suckered in... sure.
@slowdowngandhi Having a TOS is simply a corporate reality. They ha e to limit the platform to confirm to the laws of the US (being US-based) or risk being called an accomplice in anything illegal a user might do. Also commercial liability insurance acquisition will demand it. Price of doing biz.
@slowdowngandhi I'd think it'll still have to comply with a country's laws.
@slowdowngandhi It's the hashtag used during Trump live events.
@slowdowngandhi It's under settings!
@slowdowngandhi its in the settings at the bottom of the page :)
@slowdowngandhi lol yes! I used to love gabber/hardstyle!
@slowdowngandhi Not to put too fine a point on it, it would depend on what your thoughts were.
@slowdowngandhi One of us. One of us. One of us. http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/509/312/a1e.png
@slowdowngandhi referencing when he does a live event
@slowdowngandhi there's a difference between free speech and illegal speech. You wouldn't want a site to be filled with child porn and Islamic terrorists brainwashing people right? 
@smilesyndicate Are you out there? This platform is built for narrative joke-telling. #SpeakFreely #JokeFreely
@SmithWinston   For images, use www.sli.mg and copy the "direct link" (*.png, *.jpg) into your gab.  For videos, youtube works (will grab the still image, title, and description).  Direct links to *.gif will also display & auto-play.
@SmithWinston One out of two ain't bad.   ;-) 
@SMOKeMON  Definitely bigger than just Clinton. Look @ the ppl who donated to CF . They all have a stake in this & it's global . They need Hillary .  #ClintonBodyCount
@SMOKeMON I've taken this into account and canceled my gym membership until after the election. 
@snickerbockers It's more because Ireland traditionally has had the advantage of a state with low corp tax, that was a massive factor in making Ireland competitive in the world economy. And now the EU commission has kinda fucked that up and arguably has set a precedent if allowed to get away with
@socalMike_SD They can't even downplay it so they just won't report on it. CNN completely #BTFO
@SohnOfMan (((They))) will shut it down soon.
@SohnOfMan bruh get your facts straight il nut in your face 
@SohnOfMan come to think, I am getting sleepy
@SohnOfMan H-hate speech! Reported to SPLC!
@SohnOfMan He got more applause while being introduced than Hill did during her entire speech for the same American Legion yesterday.
@SohnOfMan lol wot
@Sooner  I honestly just don't see the point anymore. "Uh oh shadowbanned for wrong think! I had the wrong opinions oh no" If they're going to treat any user like this, they deserve no userbase at all. 
@Sooner 4800 on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4B2CGpB86E
@Sooner Absolutely. The Steak and Pork nutrition families are too often ignored. *eats bacon-wrapped scallop smothered in maple syrup*
@Sooner Does he go down below 9 anymore?
@Sooner http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/428/423/e25.jpg
@Sooner Indeed it has.
@Sooner Is this a joke?
@Sooner Oh don't you worry, they're not going to give this up. They'll find a new way to spin this, but soon they'll run out of way to spin it. 
@Sooner Oh good haha
@Sooner perhaps start seeing a nice BLT
@sooner Thank you for being my 100th follower! #GabFam
@Sooner thank you!
@Sooner Thanks, man. Gab is a superior platform BY FAR than Twitter; the extended character count makes it ideal for posting live events. IMHO, this experiment was a smashing success for the platform.
@Sooner you need to get out more 
@Sooner You're surprised?
@SpaceCoastConservative   To the tune of "Die Wacht Am Rhein"  #Gabfam #Gab #TheBand  https://i.sli.mg/YvBVxE.png
@SpaceCoastConservative  you won't let me mount a coup even if $hillary wins?  Surely the Queen is better than her, and you'll have HRH The Duchess of Cambridge ("Princess Kate") in charge soon enough   #MAGBA #LongLiveTheQueen
@SpaceCoastConservative carnival
@SpaceCoastConservative combination of them all. Hubby is a pilot, so obviously you can guess where his attention will be focused 😉 Daughter is 13 and refuses to do Disney, more of a tomboy than a princess! 
@SpaceCoastConservative Damn right I will!! Any suggestions for Orlando other than Universal and Disney?
@SpaceCoastConservative Deal👍
@SpaceCoastConservative ew why do they have that?
@SpaceCoastConservative Excellent! Can't wait👍
@SpaceCoastConservative excellent! Will do! We will be driving from Orland to Miami, so will probably have a stop somewhere in between 👍
@SpaceCoastConservative excellent! Will get together for a wine or tow🍷
@SpaceCoastConservative First time cruising for us so quite looking forward to it tbh
@SpaceCoastConservative getting a breast reduction cause it is causing me back and neck pain😳
@SpaceCoastConservative hahaha #Cringe
@SpaceCoastConservative holy crap! #Bravemomma
@SpaceCoastConservative how is the weather there in December? Coming out there for two weeks beginning dec
@SpaceCoastConservative I agree. Total megalomaniac. 
@SpaceCoastConservative I can imagine! 
@SpaceCoastConservative I thought I could count on you to take charge? Instead you joined them!!?? #ItsMoreFunThatWay 
@SpaceCoastConservative I would send you hopes to chase away the rain, but I'm pretty sure it will be coming my way next.  Stay dry and #GAB away!
@SpaceCoastConservative Nah! We are strong! We are real Africans😉👍 
@SpaceCoastConservative No problem😉 It's not something that I ever planned on doing, but the pain is becoming unbearable. 
@SpaceCoastConservative Nope! One was enough for me! Don't worry, our family are excellent mozzie repellers! Used to all variants! Been spraying since birth (malaria, dengue and now zika). Being born in a third world country has its advantages😂
@SpaceCoastConservative not yet, but would love to!!
@SpaceCoastConservative ooh! Love it! Looking forward to make some drinking buddies!!
@SpaceCoastConservative Sleep tight! See ya later 😃 
@SpaceCoastConservative thanks and yes i have but nothing so far fits me quite right. I'm not giving up anytime soon so I'm sure I'll find something. It's just a matter of time.
@SpaceCoastConservative thanks! Excellent advice, would never have thought about that! 
@SpaceCoastConservative Thanks! I believe it will. Actually looking forward being able to run on the treadmill without knocking myself in the face😂 
@SpaceCoastConservative Thanks!😘
@SpaceCoastConservative thanks, will do. Will be in Orlando for 3 days, Miami for 2 and 8 days cruising western Caribbean 
@SpaceCoastConservative The song is given freely. Do as you wish.
@SpaceCoastConservative there is no gain without some pain😂😂 It will give me an excuse to drink up a storm afterwards🍸🍹
@SpaceCoastConservative we wanted Mexico in the itinerary and there were none departing the time we are there, so had to do with Miami instead. We are definitely Going to Canaveral as hubby obviously wants to Cape Canaveral. Are he two close? (Sorry haven't checked the map yet)
@SpaceCoastConservative Yip. Got middle. Not sure about the deck, will have to check. None of us get seasick, all steady and nimble on the feet😉
@SpaceCoastConservative you wouldn't want it they're quite dangerous
@SpaceViking89 Sounds like someone wants to be a #GIFWARRIOR in the #GIFWAR .  https://media2.giphy.com/media/PohGETeTZY03S/giphy.gif  #Gab #GabFam #IntroduceYourself
@Spanishbride it's a pleasure to meet you 😃
@Spanishbride Thanks! Loving it so far 😂 
@Spanishbride yay! Kiwis rock!!
@SparkyMcFartles @agustus yeah it did happen. I go thru all the news channels during breakfast & it's always the same with CNN - biased.   This link shows the actual video with the censorship that CNN aired: http://youtu.be/G-UqapgDrVE  The original airing without censor: http://youtu.be/gwRNVM-7xyY
@Spiritedgravity Its absolutely brilliant :D
@SpunkyMcGoo I have a lot of hours on Steam, but before I started using Steam, I played from Gears dl.  I probably have about 500 hours total.  It's highly addictive.  I'm an old Diablo 2 player, so it is perfect for me.
@SRSB #NutritionTips http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25356771  Sourdough is best, long fermentation marginally better than processed - but much better than processed for people who struggle to digest bread 
@SRSB Agree
@SRSB I'm sorry if stating my observations seem like doom and gloom, but I guess that only solidifies what I stated.  It is a rather legitimate concern as many people do rely on these platforms to make a living and such is being pulled out from under them, without warning.
@SRSB its the method of pressurising etc to speed up rising time; changes structures of proteins carbs etc . I have a blog post about this  Dude your brain can only produce ATP from glucose, don't be a cuck.   You need some carbs to function properly, just dont get them from shit food #NutritionTips
@SRSB Lol. I'll tell her. She may not take it well - she never does if I let her out of her cage! 😂 
@SRSB Look up Chorleywood bread process and tell me they are the same thing 
@SRSB Lots more of us wouldn't have the courage to start though if he wasn't there to show it can be done.
@SRSB no offense, but minds has a trash UI/UX and I don't believe for a second that they have 1m monthly active users. Glad to see others rising though. We will win. 🐸
@SRSB sounds like broscience to me
@SRSB That's just as weird. 
@SRSB yeah fam get back to me when you know those 30 enzyme substrate cofactor blahblah sequences  Like I can't even comprehend your logic "everything is super complicated, but if I only modify tiny bits nothing will change"? No, lots changes #NutritionTips
@SRSB you're using the same logic as the 'calorie is a calorie' people.  Base your nutrition on facts and evidence, not logic
@Stalin for now being here and spreading the word is a massive help! 
@Stalin thank you for being here!
@Stalin yes. Sorry about that. For now please mute these users and any words or terms that may contain this content. We will have more filtering tools to help prevent this as we grow and build the product. 
@Stalin You can block it in your self-censorship settings :-)
@staringintothesun47 Also fundraiser in CA this morning.
@staringintothesun47 Best post I saw was:FUN FACT: Donald Trump has held more press conferences this year in Mexico than Hillary has at all.
@staringintothesun47 Incredibly HIGH ENERGY!
@staringintothesun47 Oh tell us what he said, I'm on the edge of my seat here!
@staringintothesun47 She needs a nap after just saying "Mexico"
@staringintothesun47 Speeches today in Mexico and tonight in Arizona. Both fantastic. 
@staringintothesun47 The world changed while you were away, Erika :)
@StarWars But what if we got on the Death Star ILLEGALLY?  #Gab #GabFam #Trump #TrumpLive #MAGA  http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/o-DONALD-TRUMP-DARTH-VADER-facebook-750x400.jpg
@StarWars I had a job interview yesterday and they asked me, Star Wars or Star Trek. I said I love Star Trek, but Star Wars all the way! They said there was no wrong answer and I said the wrong answer would be "neither" or "I haven't seen them".
@StarWars That sounds like rape.  When in doubt, I request affirmative consent.
@Static "Can I have some more, please?" Done
@Static Did you eat your meat? How can you have any pudding if you don't eat ya meat?
@Static Yup, I really wish they could have done the original. 
@Statistician #Pravda writers had the threat of Lubyanka Prison or a Siberian gulag facing them, #CNN doesn't need a threat to encourage their slavish progressivism, they do it willingly!
@Stitch Nah, DailyMotion is owned by some fucking frogs
@Stitch Pretty much.
@Stitch what? who?

@superversive  your background pic is so classy. is that a saint in your profile pic?
@superversive Hi Foz, welcome to the Gab family. I love it here and I am sure you will too.
@superversive nice 
@support  Hi Team, Is someone working on a reply to all, in case 2 #Gab are in a Gab, so reply and reply to all in that session is captured? 
@support  https://youtu.be/YWdD206eSv0
@support  Is there a verification process in place yet? #gabsupportlog!
@support  PHILIP IS COMING TO GAB  YES ALRIGHT
@support #gabsupportlog When searching for a hashtag, like #Animation, it does as expected and brings up the searched hashtag, but it also bring up any posts with the words "animation" in it. Is this how the search function was intended to work? Is there a way to limit my search to only the hashtag?
@support #TrumpLive != #trumpLive != #trumplive FIX THIS!
@support :thumbs up 
@support @a It would be amazing if I could still receive notifications for everything but not receive them in email form. Please make this possible.
@support @cary thats a lot of open windows 
@support @e @a How about an auto refresh that either displays new Gabs or tells you how many new have been posted.. maybe once every 30 seconds or so.  Kinda like "35 more gabs" button  
@support @Futhington  It's probably someone upvoting a comment, then taking away the upvote.  It leaves a notification update, but the actual message that they upvoted it disappears from your inbox.  See: https://gab.ai/Maher_the_Carpathian/posts/75330
@support About the person downvoting me to hell but making it look like it was upvotes.
@support Although our initial test of reposting to cover the timeline worked out well, i dont have enough users to make a real dent in it. it would be worth considering a method to allow GAB Admins to mark a post as "not repostable" in the DB.  this could stop a post from reposting infinitely. (1/2)
@support Attempting to mute a user does nothing. Chrome console shows a server error "vue-resource.min.js:7 POST https://gab.ai/self-censor/preferences/users 400 ()"
@support can you mute gabbers that you don't follow when they are reposted by gabbers that you follow? holy hell
@support does not happen on firefox 48 32 bit, with a forced windows or mac identity 
@support Gab is kill 😢 
@support Getting ever loading pages this morning. Using firefox. I don't do google/chrome. Here's the status bar. https://justplainfedup.us/wp-content/uploads/everload.png
@support Good to know.  I will save for laters then.  :)
@Support haha I just noticed y'all moved the button like 5 spaces to the right 😂  Thanks for the halp y'all! Now I won't be reporting half of my #GabFam on accident 😭
@support Have you seen what's been happening to me?
@support Hey somethings wrong with my browser. Can support my it?  /jk/  https://sli.mg/Vzry3b
@support hope it is him...  #win
@support I fixed the problem I was having  with icons not showing while having noscript installed. Had to go to http://code.ionicframework.com and unblock them. For some reason this site isn't listed on noscript for gab but once i unblocked it everything is just as sexy as the phone app. #NoScript
@support I just wanted to use this --->  👀 
@support I think the flag should be somewhere in the corners. 
@support i think you saying "please do not abuse" is guaranteed to streisand
@support I was too busy trying to figure that crap out myself, I should have told you guys a lot earlier.
@support I was wrong, 300 characters is not enough for science-ing 
@support If you click it, does it immediately report the post, or will it prompt an "are you sure" or something similar?   I don't want to click it and mistakenly spam you with a reported post that shouldn't of been reported ;)
@support if you're using anything other than Chrome or Firefox then you don't belong on the internet ! 😁
@support it's all sorted now thanks, it seems it was a temporary issue that was resolved pretty quickly. 😃
@support Its all good,folks can just wait a bit to see my lovely ass.
@support looks as though gab.ai/home reverts to a 500 ISE error.  I get that when I click on gabi icon.
@support My censored word list doesn't seem to be working. I'm seeing the "F" word still. #SupportLog   I'd appreciate it getting fixed. I don't want to start that being part of my vernacular and exposing myself to it will do that. #NotWhatIWant
@support people are disagreeing with me, i've flagged their posts  BAN THEM FROM THIS FREE SPEECH WEBSITE 
@support Personally, I would appreciate a way to "star" certain solid-content gabs, so as to make finding them easier for future reference. I "like" a lot of stuff, but I don't want to dig through all of it to find the really useful gabs. Maybe a little "fly" in the corner for the juicier ones?
@support self censorship appears to be borked
@support Sorry, I didn't know what that flag thing was and I clicked it by accident like twice. #MyBad #DontBanMeBro
@support Speaking of which, how does one become verified? Just curious because it's different everywhere. Some make you give real name, business, etc; Just wondering because I am the real Teddy/TME
@support Thanks for the heads up. 
@support Thanks gabby <3
@support Thanks!
@support thanks, was just curious 
@support the ability to repost though could be considered free speech and limiting the ability to repost censorship.  Thats something that needs to be hashed out.. (2/2)
@support TY. 
@support Uh so my fat finger accidently pressed the red triangle "!" button instead of the repost button next to it. I tried to press it again & it won't go away 😭  Is this a flag/report button? Is there a way we can move it somewhere else, not so close to the repost button? Halp!  #gabsupportlog
@support was obvious, but thanks for clearing it up, you guys really need that separate admin only feed or hashtag for announcements!
@support What about a system to flag stuff sensitive but also why it's sensitive so ppl can choose to look or not. Like a label saying porn, graphic, violence, or gore. B/c some might be ok with porn but not gore, etc. 
@support when you click it does it come up with a message stating what are reportable offenses and what the punishment is for repeated abuse of the reporting system, then asking to confirm sending report?
@support Where can you read Gab.ai's terms of service?
@support yep all off now, the person is muted, it's all done 
@support. How do you send a link to a #gab post?!?
@supprt  429. Too many attempts. Can you slow down a little?  #seriously?!  If you would get sockets working .... No need to Refresh!
@TCWilliamson Addicted to this type of social media. Love to debate. Hubbie & I are on an island & all I've got is this damn phone. Lol, no menu at all. Look forward to "gabbing" in front of a computer. 
@TCWilliamson Dark comedy maybe. 
@TCWilliamson g'night
@TCWilliamson I do the same. But I'm sure after a while it may get cluttered or become something people stop paying attention too. Or it may even be neat for them to be recommended to follow other people who are also new. Give them other users they can grow with.
@TCWilliamson I see that desk photo on your profile...wonderful!
@TCWilliamson Lets do it!
@TCWilliamson that just breaks my heart 😂 
@TCWilliamson Tkz my fellow Navy veteran! Learning my way around. Not so easy, yet I'm on a smart phone. 😲
@Teddi I'd think that for legal reasons there needs to be one. "This person is breaking the law" kind of level.
@Teddi or better yet, make the button delete their account
@Teddi there are extreme exceptions though, like child pornography and shit like that, but that's the only exception
@Temerity Hey, you know, you are absolutely right.  I'm just guessing but I'm pretty good at noticing patterns.  It could just as easily be he screws up big league and is just savvy enough to pull a PR disaster out of a nose dive.  Either way, it is impressive to me.  Other politicians would crash.
@Temerity I'm not so convinced that Trump is making mistakes. He seems to know the right time to create a controversy to get the media talking about him again.  And just as everyone tunes in to watch the train wreck, he delivers a stunning correction and performance.  That's the pattern I've noticed
@Templar_Gamer That's always annoying.  "DO YOU SMOKE"  "n-no" "WOW ARE YOU SURE" "well unless I'm sleep smoking"
@Teridax >> "#Gab is for pedophiles"  ...And right on cue, here you are.
@Teridax >> "@mf hang yourself, fatso"  I believe you may have a keyboard issue. There are several settings that get confused; QWERTY, Dvorak and Mouthbreather.
@Teridax >> "@mf i'll be on greater footing when i fuck your wife"  Aren't you just the sparkling wit? Why I bet you're the life of the party. Or at least the resuscitation attempt.
@Teridax >> "@mf it's @Teridax you illiterate black fuck"  Wonderful! I can't spell and you're blind as a New Jersey power failure. We're on equal footing.
@Teridax >> "@mf oh hey, you're from austin? me too! let's meet up"  I'll have to hold out for your vaccination records for kennel cough. Can't be too careful when you're already overdue for distemper.
@Teridax aka gamergaters aka alt righters
@Teridax everyone here is alt right this wont work
@Teridax hell yeah 👶
@Teridax If Trump supporters were leftists, then that wouldn't be far fetched.
@Teridax k.
@Teridax sexy 
@Teridax That's a fully grown woman.
@Teridax was wondering when you'd post this 
@Teridax You have to mail in a stool sample. Make sure you tell the postal worker exactly what it is and why you're sending it.
@Teridax 👀
@TerriMarsh Damn, I need better reactions.
@TerriMarsh I have a problem with this video, time 1.23 shows the still white corpse in one piece... no it wasn't in the body, or it would have been blown to bits, not still perfectly clean on the frame. 
@TerriMarsh It is appropriate that they got some just rewards.
@TerriMarsh It's not a matter of trusting someone, but by watching that video, you can clearly see it was not the dead body that was the bomb, something else was, as that body was still in one piece. I'm just a supporter of truthful stuff. not condemning your friend.
@TerriMarsh We've got to have some fun, I'm still waiting to get pounced on 🙄
@TerriMarsh Wooohoooo!
@TeutonicFuror  But you're participating in technological history & the ultimate in free speech. Professor should be grading you on your pioneering spirit. Give stink eye back

@TeutonicFuror everyone , but start with @shorty, and me🐸👍
@TeutonicFuror He's intruding into your safe space, time to file a human rights complaint
@TeutonicFuror start rubbing your nipples, you're a fucking adult now.
@TeutonicFuror start with @CarlCuck and the go with @Callum, you'll end up just deleting your partition and going Luddite, finding yourself in nature, falling in love, marrying, having children, and living happy and fulfilled. You're welcome from the @Gab Family.

@TH  Goodness, I hope not. They allow the TMing of so many stupid things these days...

@TH Breaking stereotypes are we??!
@TH Bück Dich! 
@TH can I have an #Amen. #RiseAbove
@TH Can't beat the #WomenOfGab. Wew, lad!
@TH Coincidentally I'm reading an awesome book that is literally about the heat death of this planet. LOL! :) 
@TH Damn, major troll?
@TH Did you go to @support? I need to turn off my email nots as well. TOO much.
@TH doesn't matter what they think, we ( #GabFam ) do💕
@TH Don't mention it x
@TH Don't support Hillary either.  This election has me very very sad.  
@TH Erhmahgerd he oppressed half my ethnicity 
@TH ERMAGERD I *LOOOOOOOOVE* Rammstein! #TheBand #GabFam
@TH Fecking twice, I believe.
@TH fuckin wisdom mate
@TH gently is always the best way. Like I said #PeopleSuck 
@TH German. Not Austrian nor Swiss.
@TH good, because I'm tired. 
@TH ha, drink, inhale, sometimes don't bother w adding water. #Coffee 
@TH have you tried muting the person?
@TH Hey Tony, glad to be here 
@TH how are you today? ☀️
@TH http://giphy.com/gifs/life-runner-homestar-PAcaDLSEgHMHK
@TH I actually lay awake in bed embarrassed by some things I posted online lol. I'm really sensitive I guess
@TH I already did, it's just odd that most email providers mistake it for spam. Need that sig on it.
@TH I appreciate your reluctance. I don't believe in religion but I do believe in my Saviour. How awesome for your mom, I'm sure she greatly benefits herself and others by her service to people in need.  Some people just need a soft place to fall and when all else fails they go to the church. 💕
@TH I can and will use them... For all of you here. #PrayingMom #ItsJustWhatIDo 
@TH I can imagine, we will face the same problem here if Hillary is elected.
@TH I couldn't find the time today.. I kept trying but there's   #NoRestForTheWicked 
@TH I couldn't stand the show myself, but everyone surrounding me loved it so much, I couldn't help but see some of it. That line, however, is quite a famous catch phrase here in the States. 
@TH I don't need to, I'm an entitled Millennial :P
@TH I feel like I have been away forever. #MissingAllOfYouToo 
@TH I figured just wanted to make sure. I've yet to see anything worthy of flagging. 
@TH I got trolled last night, too but I don't sweat it. If it put joy in their life to do it, then we both win.  OG
@TH I have you well trained :P
@TH I hope they add an option to turn off emails altogether
@TH I häve ä shitlöäd öf them ön my keyböärd.
@TH I just gave you a frog, it'll balance out
@TH I just really disagree with you 
@TH I know you will, but hopefully the boys can restore what you lost! @a #FrogPoints 
@TH I know, my thoughts are always with my #BritFam as I see all the attacks spreading across western civilization.
@TH I love learning their songs in German. Only way to sing / listen to them!
@TH I love them! I bet they are awesome live!
@TH I really don't care what anybody does to their body, I believe pretty much every drug should be legal, and if people want to kill themselves, so be it. But there's new conference research (caveat: not peer-reviewed) that says e-cigs are as bad for your heart as regular. http://bit.ly/2bDaMGl
@TH I saw  I'll post some cool pics of my historical weapon armoury at some point. Have a few deactivated fun things lying about, plus the other half has a few locked away  
@TH i see.. I wish I could just post whatever I feel.. First step to being a more social person irl..  Just gotta force myself and get out of my head?? 
@TH I still can. I'm an entitled Millennial, rember? :P
@TH I swear I look away from that hashtag the rubbish pops up and gets upvotes.  Shame real science is more like "we know what doesn't work, what does work is still being figured out"
@TH I understand. Same here.
@TH I wish I had like 47 upboats for this!! :)
@TH I'm kinda Brit, 1/4; grandfather came from there. So you can count me!
@TH is that why you look grumpy? :P
@TH It's a statical fact, but I don't care about color, address the problem and fix it. Don't say black lives matter, but only focus on the smallest problems facing black Americans.
@TH It's because of men like you that free people have a fighting chance.
@TH it's probably delayed notifications. I expect you'll be getting them for a while.
@TH its like most things we as people do, if you keep doin something it get easier and over time becomes the norm, this gos both ways tho, for good stuff n bad. fat people are just lazy shit food addicts. im now in recovery. so remember kids, dont do drugs n stay in school.
@TH Jumps up and down does a cheer "One new member!!"  That's all I got!
@TH Just ignore Likes and focus on the Mentions #GabProTips  https://media.giphy.com/media/83QtfwKWdmSEo/giphy.gif
@TH LMFAO! 
@TH lucky, I honestly feel like Microsoft is run by total morons at this point dude.
@TH mobile has been a disaster ever since sinofsky left, they fired the wrong dude 
@TH Nah, just helping out with the umlauts.
@TH nah... This is my jam.  https://i.sli.mg/j98ovh.png
@TH Night watch! Solid.
@TH no but we sure can listen to you tell us
@TH No offense taken, the Dutch are great. I was indeed having a conversation with a Dutch gabber yesterday.
@TH no one owns a #Cat , they just let you think you do. You are the #Cat 's butler.
@TH No problem at all. Actually I average around two drinks a month- primarily because I'm one of those unfortunates who does not get drunk; I just go directly to "sick." I'm known as the go-to designated driver of any party.
@TH No, you insensitive cis-gendered colonial dingbat, there are cultures that worship coffee. How dare you.
@TH nope my last this was a downvote to test it, all i did was click fast (fixing that now)
@TH Nope. I took it at face value. Should I ask what it means?   (I am going to learn so much British slang on this board!)
@TH not at all. That's how I was yesterday. :/ there is no mute. There needs to be a mute. 
@TH Not that there's anything wrong with that.
@TH Not yet, but soon. 
@TH now that is a new idea!
@TH Oh that is one that is American!!  It is from the sitcom Seinfeld. 
@TH ok i bet i will
@TH ok I'm good. I still think people suck, but I want you to #SpeakFreely
@TH Once again much better on explanation than the initial read.  :-) 
@TH One of my blogs is TMed and it is a pretty common term. I was as shocked as my attorney when it was granted.   SMH
@TH One....
@TH personally i think twitter has a 5 year life span ahead of it, based of previous internet of things happening, and in 2 years it will be full of ads worse than it is now. But hey what do i know, i am the only genius level hick in this county
@TH Please don't take my questions as disrespectful, but as a scientist, I just want to understand why they chose the variables they did.  Do any vapers (is that a term?) vape for 30 minutes? If not, why do you think they chose that time point?
@TH rebel without a cause
@TH Regret, hindsight and experience. Chalk it up to learning and continue on, my friend.
@TH replaced my Nokia 925 with a OnePlus three last month. Still miss that 925 sometimes tho 😢
@TH same user name
@TH send him dick pics
@TH seriously ? Does the @support team know? Is the Bug on our side or a #Hack. I'm not well learned on this stuff :/ 
@TH sleep well 😁
@TH Sleep! It's 2:30 am.
@TH So 30 minutes is longer than a "regular vaping session?"
@TH So you're the one!
@TH so your last notifcation was a like from me?
@TH Some times that's all people want. A good dick pic. 
@TH Somebody likes you.
@TH Sorry to hear that buddy. Get better. 
@TH Sorry, wrong link in previous post. http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/08/30/vaping-could-pose-long-term-danger-to-the-heart-cardiologist-warns_n_11769776.html?1472544971
@TH Sounds like you're in denial.  👅 
@TH Thank you!!! How are you this morning?
@TH Thanks Tony!
@TH Thanks! Yep, part of the #BritFam 
@TH That (honestly) made me laugh out loud. 
@TH That account has hit me as well on a few posts. @e
@TH That sucks, some people have nothing better to do
@TH That's awesome! I'm so jealous
@TH the government is more concerned with gaining control over their people, than giving them the ability to defend themselves. Narrative over all else.
@TH they did the same to me as they did you, they don't ever @ me. It would be fruitless for them if they did.  OG
@TH This isn't the old laxative-sleeping pill we've all heard of is it?
@TH told us what.
@TH TOO LATE
@TH Too late. That first happened 240 years ago.   :-) 
@TH Try @support.  The hashtag is #gabsupportlog 
@TH very good today, and you have wonderful manners. Did I miss anything exciting? I can't wait until my kids go back to school so I can #GabAllDay 
@TH we all have to find our passion. I'm glad she found hers. :) and that she has a wonderful, supportive son.
@TH Well feck you and your hairy, white, colonial, tea-drinking, opium smoking white arse :P
@TH well maybe one day there find a real friend that they dont have to pull a string to make talk.  #EmptyLivesMatter
@TH well then I am off to the market.
@TH well they must have weight the cost before making the decision. and I think that its small enough for them not to care. Or they will just pay less to other streams to make up the difference in the long run. This is calculated censorship at its finest 
@TH well we can find some together. #GabFam 
@TH What about replying to?
@TH what like dead people?
@TH When we get sigs here (if we get sigs here) that would be an excellent one! LOL
@TH when you should feel like   https://media.giphy.com/media/wVSJ2RcMTHGfu/giphy.gif  #TheBand  OG
@TH who's trolling the #FrogPoints? #SayWhat 
@TH Why not, it's fun ;)
@TH WOW if someone life is that empty that they have to nick your frogs they can have them all! they prob dont have anyone to talk to so they take frogs (that arnt real) to be there friends. #sadtimes
@TH YASS!!!!  I've been learning some Russian as well as German - check out Serebro (Серебро). I put the Cyrillic lyrics next to the English ones and read / sing along (in Russian, while reading the Russian lyrics - actually don't care too much abt the Eng). Amazingly effective!
@TH yeah I have similar  Fucking handgun ban
@TH Yeah I'm actually not really that concerned.  People will follow when they follow.  
@TH Yeah, one troll wanting to screw with the system by downvoting everything on a person's timeline- Seems like an edge case that will need resolved before going fully open. @support @a
@TH yeh iv lost a load, no idea how many. how do you know who done it so they can be muted? 
@TH Yep. Using my victim card to tap into the white guilt reserves :P
@TH Yikes. 
@TH you are most kind. 😊
@TH you had frogs kidnapped too?
@TH You'd think....but my look today can best be described as "Oh, look at that poor raggedy homeless girl" so it's not like clothing was an improvement. 
@TH You're not new. Shesh.
@TH you're sweet. But I feel bad. #MeanPeopleSuck 
@TH you're welcome. 
@TH Yup. But as more people join, the * is more and more crowded... and I can't honestly always tell who is new. 
@TH 😉💕💕💕
@TH 🤗 I can share. 
@The_Caveman And stupid.
@The_Caveman Fuck, I suppose not. Melissa clearly violates the Twitter rules by being a smart black female conservative Trump supporter.
@The_Caveman it's what #MomsDoBest 
@The_Caveman LOL! 
@The_Caveman That's the point, though, really it is.  When this takes off after it goes public, there will be a vacuum on other social media sites.  Some will come looking for a fight, others out of curiosity.  And we have prep time to have our arguments down to an artform. They will grow or run.
@The_Caveman Trust me, Scott, your not the minority.
@The_Caveman Wtf again?? Ridiculous.
@TheHumungus idk the "if it even comes to that". Probs just my English skills but what could come quicker than sending them back immediately?
@themotherface  Wow 👌😉🔥

@themotherface Superman. Because he's got the power to do almost anything he wants to, and he chooses to use it to serve justice - pure and simple. I think he's the best superhero role-model if nothing else.
@themotherface what you up to?
@themotherface Wows. Point. Set. Match.   #BabesofGab
@themotherface YES!!!!!
@themotherface Youtube have issued new guidelines that makes it much harder to monetize videos that contain "content inappropriate for advertisers". Which includes "News about controversial or sensitive subjects, even without extreme imagery."  So in other words, trying to kill indie news outlets.

@thenekdik 10-feet higher and inward until it becomes an actual #OrgyDome
@thenekdik and as you get older you can't eat as much unless you burn more calories in a day thru exercise. 
@thenekdik bwaaaa😭😭 I am #Triggered.....ok, over it👍😉😘
@thenekdik exercise actually burns few calories  Its a combo of shit diet and doing nothing - then getting bored and mindlessly eating more shit  
@thenekdik https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoLi4rC6xm8
@thenekdik If anyone could tell me how strong the blast would have to be on that fault line...
@thenekdik My wife is the real unicorn. She is 1000 lbs and has cornu cutaneum. It's why I married her. #OhCarl #UnicornsAreReal
@thenekdik settings page from your profile 
@thenekdik That would solve a whole lot of problems.  Then we could go to the East Coast and do the same thing with DC  #SaySomethingOffensive
@thenekdik the idea that one can simply go on a diet, instead of change their eating habits, and expect long lasting weight loss and health is a sad one  #NutritionTips
@thenekdik True, but I'm in the minority. I've always been active but I let my diet go when I got the super hot girlfriend back in late 2008 and my amount of activity couldn't compensate. I had to finally give in that running, my choice of activity, alone wouldn't cut it.
@thenekdik turning off the notifications in settings will only turn off email, not on site notifications.

@TheQuQu But le filters man said they were Saudi financed
@TheQuQu Honestly, I think the ICANN transfer is a bigger deal than that, even. If the UN gets a hold of it, brands might not even need to.
@TheQuQu I thought they both had the same owners
@TheQuQu now that I think about it, they did hit hillary a fair bit bc butthurt over sanders getting screwed. there are no honest poli pundits that support her - just shills lol
@TheQuQu o shieeet, i have not seen this one yet! @HarmfulOpinions has been shitting out vids like it`s nothing lately, I can barely catch up. Keep it up fam, now to watch
@TheQuQu Sleepy pooka.
@TheQuQu There's a decentralized, open source content hosting platform out there called Mediagoblin, too. I know there's some anon that runs an instance, but I forgot the address. It's similar to GNUSocial in how it operates.  http://mediagoblin.org

@TheSibylSpeaks Can we have that promise in writing please!
@TheSibylSpeaks can't say i have - maybe @support can assist
@TheSibylSpeaks following back, baby! #GabFam
@TheSibylSpeaks For a post you can't. Upload it on your blog and then drop the link in the post here and it will show. The px is only 470px x 200px - they all look like panoramic views to me.  
@TheSibylSpeaks Hello. You can't directly upload pics yet. Not in the Beta version. Recommended procedure is to use http://i.sli.mg/ upload your pics there and use supplied URL in #Gab  ATM pics window is limited to 470px wide by 200px high - this will probably change.  search #GabTips for more... 
@TheSibylSpeaks Hey Anthony!   Now that you are here, the real laughs can begin. ;-)   #Gab #GabFam 
@TheSibylSpeaks hmm that is odd. I reported this bug. thanks for your concern :)
@TheSibylSpeaks How much did you add to make up for the (slight) alcohol burn off?  Asking for a friend.  #Gab 
@TheSibylSpeaks I need to get a proper profile pic up. Although the one I have now is remarkably close to my pre-morning coffee face.
@TheSibylSpeaks It would definitely please me!!

@TheSibylSpeaks oh yay!!!! our posse is assembling!
@TheSibylSpeaks on the left the gray up and down arrows with a number in between. If you click the up arrow the number goes up. Try it.
@TheSibylSpeaks Once there is, you will know about it :)
@TheSibylSpeaks the english one will have the promise & the arabic one will actually say "we keel u"
@TheSibylSpeaks upload them to a service such as sli.mg and post the link to a gab
@TheSibylSpeaks weird. Never got this reported.
@TheSibylSpeaks what was?  OG
@TheSibylSpeaks Yes.  I just keep using the same password and it accepts it.
@TheSibylSpeaks Yw, we're all pretty helpful here so far :)
@ThomasRHart And exactly how old are you? 😁 
@ThomasRHart I also don't think looking at the world through an objective lens can be classified as a faith system. I do not belong to a cult that demands blind faith. I believe in the support of evidence and Aristotelian logic in government as much as anywhere else.
@ThomasRHart I can't tell if this is real or not send help 😬 
@ThomasRHart I have that book, but it's not the only one!!!  Equal is unfair  The moral case for fossil fuels The dim hypothesis Life Inc,  The communist manifesto Das capital The capital( Piketty)   I agree that it's the iteration that's important, Find what works, do it , get rid of what doesn't  
@ThomasRHart I spent time with a rich exchange student from Duesseldorf my cousin had for a month. He was pretty open with that opinion, even in a restaurant. We kind of had to try to quiet him when he started advocating recolonizing Africa to "teach them governance," though.
@ThomasRHart I think I remember Scott Adams making the point that the Star Trek future wouldn't happen. Mostly because you wouldn't trust your co-workers to beam you anywhere when they can't even be trusted to put more paper in the copy machine.
@ThomasRHart I would even sell the roads if I could, but I am a radical.  All water should be private owned, all resources, no such thing as government property. No such thing as communal property, no such thing as a societal good. Society is just you and me, after all. 
@ThomasRHart it is if the state is not separated from the economy, the democracy means that the majority can steal from The minority by voting. As in the 1% has all this wealth, if we vote to raise their taxes, it's legal, but tyrannical. Must separate economy from state. You keep what you earn
@ThomasRHart It's ironic the way big corporations have been more successful at spreading #Communism in the U.S. than the government ever has.
@ThomasRHart let's say that a community needed water, does it make sense not to share the pipes that delver it? No So have a co-op like they do for fuel for farming. The coop is run by a board that has one job, and they are easy to fire. Not gov.  
@ThomasRHart lol🐸🐸🐸
@ThomasRHart Maybe you just have an 'old soul'...
@ThomasRHart my point exactly. I think we agree on this. I'd the east wants roads, you are free to build them. There is an opportunity cost to taxes that price never talk about. Leave the wealth created by people to be used by the people that created it. Be free to create more
@ThomasRHart that's because we keep building political systems in which a "stong leader" is required because "the will of the people is ignored"  The truth is that a democracy is tyranny and will always lead back here. Marx was wrong about central planning, Rand was right about the role of governmen
@ThomasRHart that's right, so leave it to the municipal gov. To figure out. Feds should only do military, and judiciary, and police. Leave roads to the states and provinces. What do you think are necessary communal things? 
@ThomasRHart Wish Western Civilization had a safe word!
@ThomasRHart ya I disagree, I have gov owned water, it's terrible and have to boil it anyway. We sell our hydro to the states and buy back wind energy at twice the price, the loss paid for by the tax payer.schools are in a steady decline in both excellence and attendance. 
@ThomasRHart ya,for sure, I am with you, I just hate the west minister parliamentary system so fucking much I can taste it. I hate having my neighbours vote more money out of my pocket every god damn election. One day it will end, and then what?   constitutional republics work better
@ThomasRHart yes and politicians take advantage. Especially in Canada, where we transfer billions to small provinces whose industry went broke, now entire populations exist on gov handouts. Quebec, all the east, Manitoba now and Ontario do t make enough to pay their own bills due to over regulation
@ThomasRHart Yes, but Lawrence had a "quality" them devils liked, and he liked it to...
@Thorn Nice
@Tiby So true! 
@TimC @Jesus If this is a test of faith, he needs to provide a bigger devil to confront. 
@TimC Damn, she's hot too. I'd totally let her kneel on a matt of my pubic hair, face east and yell "Allahu Ackbar!" at my ballsack. Then, and only then, would I agree to not mutialte her genitals. #SaySomethingOffensive @WomenAreRuined
@TimC fuck. then it must've been a lie. I really must be a brony :(
@TimC Great idea! 
@TimC Hah! ;)
@TimC I haven't, but I get the idea. Lol
@TimC I loved Rand, I was hoping for a Trump / Rand ticket but Pence is solid too 
@TimC If you Gab it They will come. #GabFam
@TimC NO! I believe he said "Renze is not a brony, this is a conspiracy made by Putin"
@TimC shit dude
@TimC then watch some kiddy pron 2 get over the bad habit /s (ps /s is short for /sarchasm)
@TimC Well, I think I get it even without having seen tpb......who hasn't needed a piss jug at some point? ;D  
@timgeelen  Yes!  You go through them faster than you realize.  Have fun with it!
@TME "wrecking bomb" I never meant to start a war..I just wanted you to let me in...https://i.sli.mg/HoY3f4.jpg #makeasongislamic
@TME Also I'm not one of the downvoters - just chucked in 2c worth.
@TME ALSO" (A) Practicing polygamists Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible. So THAT knocks out a bunch of people from Africa!
@TME ask his agent yo, I got no pull with @m. Also if you're gonna give him protein check with his personal trainer.
@TME b-but th-that's not what I s-said *triggering intensifies*
@TME Everything with a pulse that doesn't agree with "The Narrative" is a racist/sexist/bigot/homophobe/whatever.  #Trump - whatever anyone may think of him, is a populist, self-funded and has massive pull in the electorate because he appeals to the younger Right, and the disaffected left.
@TME Here in SA the so-called "Liberal" government has actively kept the bulk of the electorate uneducated to guarantee a vote.  It's worked for 20 years...  Until two months ago, when the incumbent got their asses kick in local elections. It's only local, but it was enough.  People eventually learn
@TME I dunno. I mean @m is a queen unto himself. But we can introduce you at least.
@TME I fucking get it you fucking white male!! 😜
@TME I still spelled Sharon's wrong because that's how much I hate Google now..bahaha
@TME I was going to put that but I didn't want to google how to spell sherona because Google loves Hillary bruh
@TME I'm sure they will come here eventually. Just enjoy the quiet now before they do. Because once they get here, they will be yelling, calling us names, attacking us and picking apart each word we say, etc.  Honestly, they all seem like miserable people. I'm enjoying the quiet right now. 😂 
@TME jokes on you, i don't have any guns
@TME Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  I have zero frame of reference as I'm not "on the ground" like you guys (though I wish I was - legally, of course).  But I'll say this: with the amount of spin the media puts on the election, the turnout at his events - I think Trump's in pretty solid.
@TME Modern new social Ctrl-Left liberals. Classicals are great.
@TME Not that I have any effect on the election, not that I have particular love for either candidate - so as an outsider, and an observer I'll say this:  #Trump put his foot in his mouth now and then. #Hillary has had people whacked with drones.  Lesser of two evils to anyone looking in.
@TME NUUUUUUUUU 
@TME Pretty terrible I'd guess.
@TME That would be because the Illiberal Left have zero sense of history and the dangers of incumbency.  Thing is that #Trump appeals to the average fellow/lady on the street, which is usually the bulk of electorate. And when an electorate gets fed up - it'll vote out of spite (former Bernies)
@TME Totally :^)
@TME True @LaurenSouthern is totally a #BabesofGab. Her awesomeness knows no limits. 
@TME We already have some trolls here trying to stir up trouble. Sad people with no life.
@TME Well, we aren't all hard core far-right. I'm more of a moderate/centrist. I'm pro-choice and I support gay marriage. But I'm still voting for #Trump What do you want to discuss and debate? 😂 
@TME You know hopefully these #BabesofGab will learn that are hearts can only take so much. 
@TME You see Teddy and this image is the only thing connected to this persona on the internet. There is the TME/ThatMonkeyEmperor, Trajan, and then there is my name on a few newspapers and my parish's website. 
@TN_Viking excellent point, hence making the "voluntary" form more insidious.  And if you will forgive the comparison: the same argument could be made for "terrorism" vs. nation-sanctioned combat.
@TN_Viking Haha got it, just guessed by the "TN." Well shit the Big XII is well represented here already. 
@TN_Viking Oh shit, Vol fan? Already found a WVU fan on here. 
@toastedbrains someone once told me he tried 狗肉, said it was mediocre at best.
@ToastQueen But...chocolate is the food of peace!
@ToastQueen I do not foresee a new YT but the fact that they fought so hard against PIPA and now choose to censor people is absurd. It is as if they wanted PIPA all along because people on the internet have different ideas.
@ToastQueen I give macro-fucks (insert creepy, salacious laugh)
@ToastQueen just kick back and enjoy the ride...
@ToastQueen Micro-fuck? My dirty mind is spinning in all kinds of directions.
@ToastQueen Nice...nice :D

@Tool @oath  just saw this  https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/#6hjFeaSlpzjJpxK2.97  know anything?
@Tool @phil Chill. Let them go to Canada if they want to. Why you ask?  I'll just leave this here.  #TrumpLive #MAGA #GabFam  https://youtu.be/LOfn-8OKVL0
@Tool An experienced admin is so hard to find and usually well compensated, at least in UK. Is it different in Houston?
@Tool Are you a developer as well?
@Tool Certainly less than UK, but considering cost of living the differenced won't be so large. Take a look: http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/uk/linux%20administrator.do
@Tool Cool, so what's your story? You have 297 characters. GO 😁 
@Tool Correct, but I moved to UK not long ago. English is my second language.
@Tool did you say they could use power tools?
@Tool Doing the same, enjoying the tranquil evenings. Thinking about getting a #Gab Discord set up or tinker around some ideas for #GabPodcasts. Ideas to help conjure up Gab content. #OhCarl
@Tool Don't threaten me with a good time! #OhCarl #WhatALoss
@Tool haha last linux distro i had was yellowdog on the ps3.. might do some research!
@Tool I actually get to use twitter? Hipsters can not even fathom the irony here #OhCarl
@Tool I bought 3 shirts... $95 total 
@Tool I did. I think I done cucked it up. #OhCarl #SocialMediaKlutz
@Tool I just discovered it by accident on my tab.. I never turn it sideways..
@Tool I might just dual-boot linux...
@Tool I'm getting close to #400....just a fewwwww more
@Tool ikr! 🙁 
@Tool it is. not for beginners (well i install Xbuntu on older machines for the elderly who only web browse if i have to fix it more than once and windows theme it)
@Tool luckily i didn't tell you I saw redhat on floppies, asshole!
@Tool oh ty
@Tool She won't believe when you tell her about the conversation we just had. It amazes me how small the world has become in my lifetime.
@Tool someone who also doesnt get tagged sadly.
@Tool sorry meant the Gab Store, trying to trade in my frog points so I can buy a gf
@Tool That's great, thanks. I grew up in Wielkopolska and was living in Poznań for 10+ years, so I know the region. How good is your Polish now? Good enough for casual conversation and reading? I've studied in Spain for 1 year and I know how quickly you forget the language when you don't use it.
@Tool That's surprising. So what's the average admin salary like? Is it just this region or the same all over US? Even an average, getting-the-job-done type of admin is not that easy to find here and certainly not in Poland. How is the rest of IT in Houston compared?
@Tool That's the main reason I haven't visited America or Australia yet.
@Tool The first campaign was at cost on Teespring, but many international Gabbers faced steep shipping costs and wanted more options to choose from. We crowdsourced this as an option and decided to go with it until we can look into other options.
@Tool The regressive Carl is back in the closet. He triggered himself to sleep for a bit. Just normal boring carl https://i.sli.mg/DyfGyp.jpg #OhCarl
@Tool They look like a lot of fun and  would give #Gab exposure and something for #GabFam to listen to. Very suitable for a free speech theme platform. #OhCarl #GabNation #GabCasts
@Tool Wish I was. Points 1, 2 and 4 seem sort if sensible but 3 and 5 are pretty open to interpretation and of course abuse. https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en

@TrumpTrain NO BRAKES!!
@TrumpTrain Not worried about that, worried about snake-weasel McCain with snake-weasel Rubio with snake-weasel Ryan  There's more work to do than just Trump - and so far, the folk have not brought the torches & pitchforks to bear on those that need to be OUSTED. 
@TrumpTrain thanks for the follow!
@TrumpTrain Then why didn't they help him by pushing that old fuck McCain off his perch?  I am REALLY pissed off at AZ.   Give the fucking thing back to Mexico
@tsukle   Ok, follow-up question for Mr Spider.  Is it true that if I inject you with an 8% solution of highly refined thorium (or other radioactive actinide) and then let you bite me, that I'd gain a number of super powers?  I read that somewhere.  Signed, Spider Curious #SpiderQandA

@tsukle ME too!  Did you deliberately leave the banana peel to slip on it?
@tsukle nic, thanks for sharing
@tsukle Oh, I didn't realize you are a developer of this site. Yeah I meant Javascript. If you are looking to put some banner ads on your site ever in the future, I know who can do it - you will never be banned or hassled for non-PC and you can withdraw to bitcoin directly if you want.
@tsukle Oh, nice. Are you employed or hobbyist programmer? 
@tsukle Send some my way!! lol

@TYT I hear you. Some people use follower numbers as an extension of their dicks. My main T account has 18K followers but I've found that mo' followers = mo' problems and my dick is big enough in its own right & so I created a new Twitter account that I keep smaller cuz follower numbers don't matter
@TYT I hope and truly wish you are right! As long as she doesn't roll over like Cameroon did, that would be swell😉
@TYT I really hope she sticks with it! 
@TYT Thanks for the help!
@TYT was upset but now....nah!!
@TYT Well, GAB is new and it's a lot of seasoned Twitter folk that come from big numbers and probably feel a little odd that they don't anymore. Twitter has the ticks as well. Things will normalize in time as people become used to things over here. :)

@uhohkeelysawake Holy crap, if someone hits my kid like that they're going down hard. 
@uhohkeelysawake I can help @pussy rub it in too :P
@uhohkeelysawake I find that offensive 
@uhohkeelysawake I need to finally use this giant jar of Tahini taking up cupboard space.  Once I make my first batch maybe I will finally make Kombucha instead of get owned by GT's at the grocery store.
@uhohkeelysawake I recently became an executive officer in Staff Senate.  The way that the government has changed the way State Universities get money (The Metrics System) is absurd!  So happy to finally have a means to share the problems with the public!
@uhohkeelysawake I will keep this in mind.  Wise!
@uhohkeelysawake i've been thinking the same thing. I'm going to ramp up the vicious attacks and see if they off me.  I don't want to do something easy like send Leslie Jones a pic of Harambe, although that would do it for sure.
@uhohkeelysawake It's a lot like alphabet soup vomit really.  From a 3 year old.  With Zoo Biscuits.
@uhohkeelysawake Morning Keely
@uhohkeelysawake nighty night
@uhohkeelysawake Now you know how Raif Bawadi and his wife feels.
@uhohkeelysawake Oh no.
@uhohkeelysawake ok. thx for the info.
@uhohkeelysawake Or in areas where robberies may occur, but you are left with all your valuables.
@uhohkeelysawake paint parts, equipment or steel.  For example, I worked for a company that manufactured asphalt equipment and we paint all our steel in house at our paint booths.
@uhohkeelysawake personally, I'd do lots of little things, harder to undo than one mighty trigger (eg a mild joke about ISIS)
@uhohkeelysawake Sadly, I'm serious.  I've seen this come in from multiple YouTubers.  They amended their ad policy to deny people ad revenue if their videos contain controversial content.
@uhohkeelysawake Saw that yesterday. Freeeeeeeeky af.
@uhohkeelysawake so there's no moderation? 
@uhohkeelysawake That was a  Jim,  here just a stupidism
@uhohkeelysawake That's what I thought as well!  What are those two doing on the same bus??
@uhohkeelysawake The Aerosmith song "I don't Want to Miss a Thing" totally played in my head after I read this.
@uhohkeelysawake They cannot give him all 2k at once. They will have to whip him in stages. They want him to suffer, and not die. 
@uhohkeelysawake this pussy won't tattle
@uhohkeelysawake Those settings only alter your e-mails. The pop-ups within the browser and the pink totals at the top will stay.
@uhohkeelysawake Well, you'd die from so many at once. They believe that punishments like this act as lessons and deterrents. It's their fundamentals for hudud or syariah law. That's why the punishments are so extreme. Chopping off your hand for stealing, etc
@uhohkeelysawake What abt after daddy's time is over? 
@uhohkeelysawake What?
@uhohkeelysawake whatever you do,  make sure you frequently reference Gab. 
@uhohkeelysawake Why do you hate me :((
@uhohkeelysawake yes, they are.
@uhohkeelysawake you and @rose ...as my eldest would say: eye game strong. 
@uhohkeelysawake you poor fool, don't go near any trains/gyms for a while....
@uhohkeelysawake You wanna fuck? Okay what time do you wanna come over?
@uhohkeelysawake You'll want to uncheck any type of notification you'd rather not receive under the "Notification Settings" subheading.
@UltimateBeard it's to flag posts that may be an issue check @support timeline
@UltimateBeard So, another day passed and still no physical confirmation of the existence of flesh and blood Hillary supporters?
@UltimateBeard Thanks for the shout out 😀 
@UltimateBeard That's fair enough, I've seen nothing that's gone too far myself.
@UltimateBeard The left sure like to fuck over minorities & gays who don't do what they're told.
@UncensoredNews 
@UncensoredNews   I'm not backing down.  Its already backfiring among NYC supporters.
@UncensoredNews  I know where Torrington is.  Midwesterners are the best!  
@UncensoredNews  I thought I had found another Wyomingite (Is that the right word?) on Gab.  That buffalo always tricks me.
@UncensoredNews  Looking at your header- Are you in Wyoming?
@UncensoredNews How bout Mishelle?
@UncensoredNews I fear that if Hillary steals this election we will fall so far down this Orwellian rabbit hole that we will never recover.
@UncensoredNews Probably undergoing dialysis. 
@UncensoredNews She would start a war to cover her ass with no proof, just speculation.
@UncensoredNews Trump won't even let her have that win. He is barely ahead of her in the unfavorable dept also. 
@UncleHeffy Well, looks like we won't be uploading to YouTube anymore.  They went all Hitler on the rules when it comes to monetizing. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CrSBFJCW8AEGydA.jpg:large
@UncleHotep chimes in on the Trump speech last night  Trump Speech in Arizona. Let the Landslide begin #Trump2016 #TrumpAZ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXMmZICzkAo  #GabFam  OG
@UncleHotep I think he got very close, but will seal the deal this weekend in Detroit.  http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIbKNzGWcAAROm7.jpg
@UncleHotep I'm beginning to think that #Hillary Clinton's strategy all along was just to wait for Donald #Trump to say or do something that'd cripple his campaign, and there was no no Plan B if that didn't happen. Sucks to be her right now. #fail
@UncleHotep They can't stop it until the people who claim to represent them, and get the diversity dollars, are forced out.
@unclerungus ain't Skeered. Show it.
@unclerungus Biology was not in your majors?
@unclerungus don't use your actions to justify hatred of women you beat up dudes for. Perhaps you should take responsibility and learn not to fuck with those kinds of women anymore? You're sounding a little like a victim right now...
@unclerungus Dude, are you ok?
@unclerungus edgy.
@unclerungus I can't help but feel you don't hate feminism like the rest of us, I feel that you hate women for whatever one or two of them may have done to you. Don't put us all in the same box. 
@unclerungus i was making this for ya http://sli.mg/q54KYr 
@unclerungus I'm not saying I hate you, but I would unplug your life support to charge my phone.  now be a good boy and bother other people. 
@unclerungus It's notta G spot. It's a Prostate. Girls have g spots. The biology lessons you're getting must be common core. And you can always break it to me hard Carl loves it hard #OhCarl
@unclerungus neither, both never cross my mind
@unclerungus never will be, I am on the higher level of the gene pool. 
@unclerungus Nice try, After meeting you, I've decided I am in favor of abortion.

@UtahRattler This youtube might help. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlmq4jktDE  I've never posted on Twitter, so am learning as I go too.
@Vampyre It just shows if there is a will, there is a way. There is always the deflect and divert strategy.
@Vargamor That's is my greatest hope.  I prefer not to use other social media websites as an author.  Maybe I should take the risk though and make #Gab my only author comm channel to reach my readers.  But that means author spamming my #GabFam.  Presents another conundrum. 
@VeryRarePepe Glad ya like it, fam. I have 6 gorillion terabytes of Pepe memes if ya need more

@vm #Please #Delete #Remove 🙏
@vm - Hi there!  Finally was able to connect!
@vm Agree! 
@vm And while your blog link will not yet hyperlink in your profile, you can put it there.  If you drop a blog link in  a post, it will pull the schema code. It looks like a twitter link, so (just guessing) twitter cards probably need to be working on the blog. 
@vm Change your profile! What I've learned so far:   1) Cover photo: 815 X 300  2) Profile photo: 1:1 ratio  3) Post photos must be uploaded externally, link dropped in post, 470px x 200 px 5) Some of these people have no idea what #football really is  #Gab #GabFam #NFLGab
@vm check @e account for updates on features
@vm forgot to add "In the name of Peace!" 😃 
@vm Found it right after panicking lol.  I'm a dumbass sometimes :-)
@vm Glad to see the #Horde is assembling.  I'm a bit of a lurker over there, but recognized your handle.
@vm Good Morning!  Found you! 
@vm Haha!  NOW I can haz all da buttons!  En Garde!
@vm hahaha I just did the same thing, oops
@vm Hey, if you write a short gab and post it with #IntroduceYourself people will pick up on it and you should get noticed properly.
@vm hiya, babe! So good to see you over here.  #SQUEEEEEEE
@vm I clicked it on yours and now it is "active".  Looks like it might be a reporting feature to report a violation of the rules such as illegal porn or posting private info of another user.  If I had to guess.
@vm I'm set... we have a crew of contractor dudes here for the next month or so and they'd do about anything I asked, I think. 
@vm my pre-coffee face was 1985.
@vm Only a matter of time before the rest come aboard!
@vm Spell check:  @TheSibylSpeaks
@vm Thanks! I will follow them now!
@vm They do and mine are all off now, which is a pity as I used them as my notification on my phone
@vm thought I was looking in a mirror lol.  I have to figure out how big the pic should be for the banner.
@vm Welcome! Glad they've opened the gates to you. Was at your blog and was STUNNED who the new Baen author was - the first book I bought when I got my first Kindle was Perigee! Had no idea he was "one of us." I've been reading your blog, but finally made my first comment there. There will be more.
@vm Where are they?  I can't find anything lol
@vm yeah just muted, seems to have worked
@vm Yep, it's St. Paul.  Background is a sketch of St. Peter's.  
@vm You want it in English? or Arabic?
@vm 😁 
@VSovren #WhatIsWrongWithMe !!!! I'm putting myself in time out!  My gimble apologies to the beautiful and vivacious #BabeOfGab #WomanOfGab @KassyDillon 
@VSovren Some say it's an acquired taste. Like have an aftertaste and gamey. Just a warning to travelers when going there in the winter as they might accidentally eat one (if they don't want to eat dog) 
@VSovren that is  humble apologies... Can't wait for the edit button !! @a #GetToWork 
@VSovren useful. Thank you. I also heard something of that kind about customs in Japan when it comes to customer-waiter relationships.
@w8  H I G H I G H  E N E R G Y N E R G Y  #MAGA #TrumpLive
@w8 @shorty I get vegetables, #Coffee beans.
@w8 And fried tempeh with vegenaise.  Probably my favorit vegan snack next to hummus and blue corn (non-GMO of course...) chips.
@w8 he is just an old timey type of guy @a
@w8 how do you not crave bacon?  That ended my vegan run, it was just too good.
@w8 I did shit post a little with my pics of Trump and Pence, but the red wine thing was legit advice to lower cholesterol. That's why I had like 8 glasses last night after the baby fell asleep. Now I can eat bacon and red meat through the weekend. #shitpostER #sorry #nutritiontips
@w8 I'm truly allergic to dairy and gluten (not fake allergic b/c I think it looks cool) and vegan cheese is ok for me.  I must say how much I love hummus.  Always wanted to make my own but Sabra keeps pulling me back.
@w8 In a high school gym with all 50 of the people that want to hear her speak..
@w8 Kerry says it's better that voters don't know what's going on. No, srsly, he said out loud this week what has been unspoken practice for years -- to systematically under-state actual threats. Tools in "news" biz obey their plutocrat overlords.
@w8 Looks so good.  Only downside, grocery store wants to charge practically $20 for anything like that.  But still worth it.
@w8 One helps you loose weight by dropping fat.  One helps you loose weight by dropping brain mass.
@w8 slick willie has a plan set up for immigrants to take over detroit and no citizens will be hired. sounds like they are really helping the job growth of the legal citizens. lol
@w8 Suck it :P
@w8 Thank you for subscribing to #CatFacts, your hourly source for information about those four legged friends we love so much!  Did you know that cats have little ladders on their feet? That's how they climb things so well!
@w8 very true about @shorty.
@Wall hence you find the meta analysis   I'll look it up when I'm at my desk, mobile sucks balls sorry fam

@Warspite Ha! A squid is an asshole who usually rides a motorcycle in sneakers, shorts, and full face helmet, does stupid shit - danger to himself and others. Cage people=car drivers.
@Warspite Proud member of the Horde, reporting for duty.  Just gave you a follow.
@Weirddave ::looks around::  Hillary is still likely to become president. I guess that isn't *fresh* Hell, but it's still Hell.
@weirddave also, I don't know what kind of pull you have at AoSHQ but get Ace and the gang back together for more podcasts. Thanks.
@Weirddave Awesome! Thanks!
@Weirddave Dave, any other known Morons here on Gab?
@Weirddave GASP I thought you went to Texas State University! 😮 Well neighbor I'm in DC at the moment so you're still cool in my book!  AND YES SIR BORN IN TEXAS, ALWAYS A TEXAN! ❤️ 🐸 🏜  Regardless of where y'all from, we're happy to have y'all here on #Gab 😀  
@Weirddave Im pretty bullish on the Flames this year. Johnny not resigned yet but Im sure its coming soon. With even average goaltending the Flames are a strong bet to get back to the playoffs this year I think. They score plenty.
@Weirddave Medical Mutual of Ohio. But applicable to other carriers/states as well, of course.
@Weirddave no, afraid not
@Weirddave Thanks for writing about this place on the ONT. Although I'm not sure another time sucking site is really good for me, it's nice to see some social media options emerge.
@Wendar  I love the Jersey Shore! Go there every year. What beach?
@Wendar  Yeah for sure will  Nothing better than warm but refreshing water 
@Wendar Beware spoilers, but check out #TrumpLive 
@Wendar but i lovez my porn bots :( #HotSexyTrumpettesInYourArea
@Wendar Haha oh shit then definitely don't, check it out afterwards tho. High energy. 
@Wendar he's putting H to shame
@Wendar I'm sure he's outwork Hillary today by at least 18 1/2 hours then...
@Wendar loves the #GabFam as much or maybe more than bike riding. @vm loves her freedom loving books. @wocassity doesn't need an introduction, but an author with intelligence. @Nothing2Serious wants to be able to leave you alone. @TimC is one of my fav #gabbers. 
@Wendar Point Pleasant is a very good beach   Haven't been on the beach in Asbury. But I have been on the Boardwalk where I played at this arcade with old school pinball machines which was pretty cool. Also stopped by the Stone Pony too. Used 2 go to Lavallette but Sandy happened :( now I go 2 other
@Wendar Pornbots are not the worst: Islamist accounts, Hysteric leftists, biased moderation that can be in certain case life threatening. THIS is twitter. It's a trap.  https://media3.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/200_s.gif
@Wendar Youtube is getting that way also..
@wheezeful  I just tell them to suck a bag of dicks & move on with my life.  If someone is so far gone that they need to be addressed by "Xir" there's no trying to reach them.
@wheezeful English cheese is better  #LongLiveTheQueen #BritFam
@wheezeful havent been to japan yet, would love to visit there someday as well!
@wheezeful It's my favorite one & the one I carry all the time.

@wheezeful Not yet, but it'll be here, eventually.   I use http://sli.mg/

@wheezeful Yeah, there was unfortunately. I think they drafted that resolution after the Slovakian Prime Minister warned he would be refusing muslim migrants.
@WhiteMale #CheckLater
@WhiteMale #WhitePrivilege aint it grand
@WhiteMale Don't forget Ice Cube and Shaquille O'Neal. This is the kind of broad support that Republicans have said they've desired for a long time, but now that a Republican is actually getting it, they're all REEEEEEEE #NeverTrump! Are you fucking kidding me?!
@WhiteMale dude. We all had a bug the other week. It sucked so bad! Get well soon. 
@WhiteMale Ewwwww...  Shave your Elbow!
@WhiteMale faggot #pewdiepie's on the #trumptrain ! http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/08/31/pewdiepie-unverified-suspended-twitter/
@WhiteMale Good idea. As you said, though, have a list of active new users, and not just those who join and don't post.
@WhiteMale I reside in Las Vegas, and it's pretty infested with weirdos and perverts. :( I used to live in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and that's the most "normal" place I've ever lived.
@WhiteMale i'm just not feelin' it.
@WhiteMale ME TOO!!! only 290 left to go 
@WhiteMale neat, you do c# too? with unity or web or what?
@WhiteMale nighty night 
@WhiteMale SLOTH!
@WhiteMale So far, I've been going to the 'IntroduceYourself' page. I'm sure I don't find all the new members, though. 
@WhiteMale That one lonely hair :(
@WhiteMale we were discussing top right corner. Thank for your input :)
@WhiteMale yeah, you'LR picture is of Mike pence and your a white male 😜

@WillChamberlain >> "#ImWithHillary because i'm in the catheter manufacturing business and need more prominent users of my product"  You need a Celebrity Endorsement by an athlete named Willy 'Stretch' Foley
@WillChamberlain please no #NutritionTips  Half the advice might be reasonable, but the factual basis and interpretation of the evidence is nutty
@willgoon ha. I posted on #WomenOfGab that's as good as it's getting.
@Wintermute349 I give it to #TheBand to play and sing to their heart's content. #StrikeUpTheBand!
@Wintermute349 😬😀😀. Very good!  Can #TheBand play it?
@wisermonkeys doesn't membership of the EU inhibit her ability to control immigration as EU citizens have freedom of movement....and The ECHR makes it really difficult to deport Islamic fenatics..I'm still undecided if I like her, my main concerns are her stance on drug laws and online privicy
@wisermonkeys Rule Britannia and God save the Queen #Brexit
@wocassity  Either that or show a clear preference for Gab. It runs really well, looks clean, and has no ads. Why would normal humans not like it?
@wocassity  I have 2 friends that play the shit out path of exile  hell i have 269 hours, but i dont even COMPARE  great game
@wocassity  I remain highly skeptical... Just look at the Tumblr.
@wocassity  there aren't any SJWs here. That's kinda of the main issue with alternative social media. It is bound to either fail or partition by politics.
@wocassity  They do get plenty of attention from eachother. More likely "emotional security" would come first. Also they're notoriously lazy.
@wocassity  You mean you don't even think all women are scum? You fuckin' cuck....
@wocassity @carlcuck I just spit my drink out, #OhCarl 
@wocassity @Cernovich But Carl is great when you want a rap battle. Top Cuck, @CarlCuck. #OhCarl
@wocassity @Cernovich Congrats :)
@wocassity also, for those with big fingers....be extra careful and also be really really careful whilst drunk texting! It's right next to the damn repost button!!
@wocassity At least you'll die watching your favourite film.
@wocassity Could be I guess. He's certainly got everyone thinking about him as president today. Laura Ingram just referred to him as President Trump on live tv.
@wocassity Excellent stuff. Making some Kava tea.
@wocassity Fingers crossed.  A Trump win would call for a #GABFam celebration!  #TrumpLive
@wocassity go look on e's page. He explains it. 
@wocassity haha, that sir is talent.
@wocassity Hillary has the only weiner Huma needs. #OhCarl #GabNation
@wocassity How did you get picts.to post,Mine won't.
@wocassity I can see why. Arizona was a Clinton Campaign Kill Shot. She just can't deal right now which is why she's been missing. Or she just went for cigarettes. #OhCarl
@wocassity I can take them or leave them.
@wocassity I like #MakeASongIslamic better, so many options. "uptown goat" and "My black flags bring all the boys to the yard and they're like, Allahu akbar"
@wocassity I love Forest Gump. It's Tom Hanks at his absolute best. The first time I watched it I finally broke and cried at "You died on a Saturday morning."
@wocassity I take it this speech is worth watching later?  I literally had to take off when #Trump took the stage.
@wocassity I think this feature should be available to everybody, not a paid upgrade. All of the trolls I have seen so far have hugely negative frog-point scores, so allowing users to block anyone under 0 would be a great way of tuning out the spam and Goatse-trolls.
@wocassity I'm a lot more fun than @scotters. If you're going to pimp him, I definitely think you should pimp me, too.
@wocassity I'm watching too... Dude's killing as usual. #MAGA
@wocassity In their case, it's more appropriate to say "We The Authoritarians" 
@wocassity it'll make a great MLM scheme.
@wocassity It's aight bae, I can teach you dem internet slangs.
@wocassity it's certainly more thorough #TrumpLive
@wocassity It's like everyone forgot what the Soviet Union was like - and it is, to date the most "successful" implementation of Communism with *only* 100 million dead.  And the very first right they lost was the right to critique the State, and to #SpeakFreely
@wocassity it's such a pleasure. Love everything about this revolution! #FreedomForAll ❤️
@wocassity just advised it's new season, so lets trend it   I look like a young Paul Newman dressed as Matlock.  #BetterCallSaul
@wocassity Me too!  FINE! FINE! You’re gonna make me walk back and get the stickers?! I will walk back and get the stickers! #BetterCallSaul
@wocassity No, though if I was 25 years younger... 
@wocassity No,I have a reg.old desk top.I don't want it to easy to access.
@wocassity Pft, we on our own now! I stole yo shawty!
@wocassity plus, her pups are top-notch.
@wocassity Right. Might be interesting to compare and contrast the throughput you get on Gab versus Twitter; I kept my Twitter account just for PR purposes.
@wocassity run forrest run...
@wocassity Thanks for the tip, I just switched over.  #TrumpLive
@wocassity Thanks,I don't have a clue what the hell I use.LOL
@wocassity That used to be true, but they've gone full leftist. Now any organization that doesn't bow to the altar of Social Justice is automatically a "hate group".
@wocassity That's an interesting concept . . . are you able to do promo codes through Amazon?
@wocassity That's the kind of love a family needs!
@wocassity That's the main thing I've also noticed about him, W.O. Trump has an amazing ability to handle the press, the public, and turn things around even in the midst of a seeming crisis. He's definitely a brilliant man.
@wocassity The hazard button is clearly a button to send the staff a hug  #EveryonePressTheHazardButton
@wocassity Those bastards.
@wocassity too bad isn't it that we feel almost apologetic (I do at least) about still having to have a presence on FB because of what we do. Trapped now too. by all my extended family using FB to check in on each other.  I will never escape.  I hope Gab will be a place for careers to bloom too.
@wocassity Truth. I still remember being distraught that I was NEVER going to get home to see my mom again when my bus broke down when I was 5. I can't imagine what those little girls are going to remember when they're in their 30s, but I bet they remember that. It sucks all around.
@wocassity Wait, did you just pimp me out? I feel....dirty. Mwah, love you babe! <3
@wocassity Well, if deleting 30 000 emails is a felony (it is) then we can go for it.
@wocassity what's it take for you to take on new clients? 
@wocassity while this may be a good idea to file away for later, we request that you therefore ask for it later. We are currently sorting through all requests and looking for changes that will ease functionality of the site and other various bugs. we appreciate your insight :)
@wocassity Why, thank you, kind sir.
@wocassity wuuuuuut? Missed that one. 
@wocassity you flagged me! Oh, now it's war buddy! #CrossbowsvsLongbows 😝
@wocassity You know I'm just gonna steal this one too.
@wocassity You should probably shower now. #DeadBlueBirdStinks
@Wolfgang  >be successful  >be anonymous   literally pick one
@Wolfgang The internet's also jam packed full of people that think they're going to be the next Faulkner, Murrow, or Mencken. There's a glut of writers out there, but none that truly stand out. It's kind of sad. What writer defines this era?
@Wolfgang very
@Wolfgang You could go a lot of different ways with that. Anons' preference for a dualistic lifestyle between internet and meatspace, artists' intrinsic shame in their works, regardless of how liked they are, and worrying about getting lost in a sea of lit out there at the moment. Not a good mix.
@Worthog117 reported 
@Wren Thanks. That's what I was looking for. I used Twitter for a while but never really got into it and quit after they started with their SJW policies.
@WRM @ShannonMontague have a good evening you two💤
@WRM aww That's true love right there 
@WRM lol love you. 
@WRM really?! Go get the dog house outta the pit. You're sleeping in it. #WorstHusbandEver 
@WRM whatever. #IMarriedAPervert

@WrongThinkBlog great suggestion! sent it to the development team :) 
@wut Too good.
@Wyattastic I don't have that excuse being at home but it's just that fact I know it and still jump. Like the head in Jaws. I know it's coming but still...
@Wyattastic Still makes me jump every time.
@xGORDOx hear hear! 
@xGORDOx LGRS!
@xGORDOx welcome to #Gab! 👋🐸  I seriously love the fact you used the word "Masshole" & not triggers by it 😂  Enjoy your time here & #SpeakFreely! @a @e & the #GabTeam are working hard to make this an awesome place! #GabTips is great for tips! Let the #GabFam know if you have any questions!
@xo im gonna influence your dead nan
@YeaVerily "what if your nipples are raping me?". Has to be quote of the day 😂 
@YeaVerily agree. I just found it humorous.
@YeaVerily at this point I'll have to write in. I don't play the lesser of two evils game. If #Trump gets elected & turns out good I'll eat crow & vote for him in 2nd term, but based on his record I'm #NeverTrump 
@YeaVerily because i'm hella smart dawgie
@YeaVerily Could be a family under there, but we'll never know.
@YeaVerily good line. Love it.
@YeaVerily I believe many see the same problems, but different solutions.
@YeaVerily I do not disagree w/ the ideology you are presenting, I just don't believe that describes #TrumpMotives 
@YeaVerily I must admit to cutting holes in my shirts to free the nipple.  It's invigorating in the winter.
@YeaVerily I'd most certainly support a "Free The Labia" campaign.  If for no other reason but to see the confused look on many of our most prominent faces in feminism.  
@YeaVerily Obviously we need the "Balls In Hand" testicular cancer one too.  Big saggy balls though.
@YeaVerily oh I always vote. The down ticket matters.
@YeaVerily Speaking of Cancer, I have a new idea for a prostate cancer logo, a finger halfway inside an anus.  Wanted to see how many celebrities would wear it.
@YeaVerily the left is very tribal. I just try to teach 1st, be compassionate 2nd & if they get nasty I am a professional asshole.
@YeaVerily this is very true. But mind the material as beaches end to be hot, so silk might be a wise choice
@YeaVerily true and false. An opportunist in this context is purely selfish. 
@YeaVerily you give great examples of selfless opportunism, I personally don't believe you're describing #Trump
@Yotsuba And yet I'm strongly okay with that. (Compared to Hillary, of course.)
@Yotsuba damage control. Fucking ((((DAMMAGE CONTROL))))
@Yotsuba I'm just this guy you know...
@Yotsuba it begins...
@Yotsuba What do you mean "you people"?    I'm just a nerdy white guy from RVA.
@Yuffie  hey, were here to help 😃  #GabFam
@Yuffie a distraction, they turned us on each other again, so now we fight eachother instead of the people who we really should be fighting, the likes of george soros ect. i think trump is a threat to them cause his has his own power and his not part of there network. iv over simplefide everything
@Yuffie a large amount of woman are forced or coerced into wearin them, that aside banning the burka is a response to a climate of fear the idoligy they support created, so really its there own fault, the needs of the many outweigh the want of the few.
@Yuffie Ah, so BBC is possibly bordering on "involuntary".  There's a similar issue with NPR (being public-funded).
@Yuffie Good question, I suspect they have a similar issue but haven't watch must of their reporting to know for sure.
@Yuffie i agree with all your points 100% prevention is always better than cure, but as its a here n now, it need to happen. if they truly wana be apart of this country it will be a small price to pay. but they wont, they dont want to assimilate, they want to conquer. small victorys start now.
@Yuffie i belive its al about divide n concur. few years back mostly all races, colours, religions were gettin along, and due to people being tolerant of eachother, we started to notice how the establishment were the ones fucking us over. fearing the people would turn on them they created (1/2)
@Yuffie i think it gos past just hiding the face, in the light of world events we cant say the UK wont be attacked, never stop every attack, but can make it as hard as poss to carry out attacks, to much can be hidden under a Burka. not worth the risk.
@Yuffie me too - i'm hungry!
@Yuffie No, but it's fun, so we did it. :-)

@zane I actually would of agreed with your statement before Trumps very well done presser with Mehican presidente, he could of really tanked it and didn't

@ZCorbett LAD!
@ZCorbett Still going strong! #TrumpLive
@Ze #FreePewDiePie was trending here yesterday. 
@Zelda I mean Google (who owns YouTube) and Twitter have a right to do whatever they want due to them being private companies and the users "agreeing" to TOS. So they have every right to do whatever they please with the users but Twitter preaches about "Openness" so they come of a hypocritical.:-/ 
@Zelda welcome aboard the #gab train!
@ZeroCL  I'm your 400th, no big deal 🐸
@ZeroCL #AskProfessorPepe  I bet she was seated when she tweeted.
@ZeroCL #BlackPigeon is fucking BASED. Get him to the #Gab
@ZeroCL Dress him as a samurai and let the age old rivalry come to fruition.
@ZeroCL Having to guess is what makes it fun for me. It provides an illusion at least of freedom. In, say, a point n click graphic adventure game, there is rarely any input you can give the game that isn't already on the screen. That's why I love text. Well it's one of the reasons.
@ZeroCL I hear women with adult nappies, colostomy bags, or permanent catheters ♥️  her fashion 
@ZeroCL I suppose if you reside in North Korea, she is. 
@ZeroCL I think the attempted spin is to ridicule the visit as a phony photo op, because it was only a few hours long. Too short to be "serious diplomacy", therefore it's a failure. But hey, if anyone knows about failed diplomacy it's #HillaryClinton
@ZeroCL in the army we call them ninja suits. If they are colored we call them (color) ninja. Sorta like power Rangers. Dhfuirnfb shit #Triggered myself, colored, power, aaaagggghhh!!!
@ZeroCL its a joke.. you know "Ultra rare pepe.. don't download, dont save" lol
@ZeroCL man - you waited a LONG time to get that out of you....
@ZeroCL ok to download?
@ZeroCL she doesn't have to have a reason. The Mexican president could have given Trump a trillion dollars and she would have tweeted the same thing. 
@ZeroCL thanks, lot of interesting people here.
@ZeroCL TOO LATE JR!
@ZeroCL why not
@ZeroCL Yes I tried Loom too but wasn't able to maintain enough interest to get very far into it. Linearity may have been why. Love the SCUMM games!
@Zhanx @chris_story you guys are fantastic. Any bug other than upvote-downvote notification issue?
@Zhanx @chris_story you guys are sincerely the best! My son knows how to gather good people. #GoodPeopleAttractGoodPeople 👏🏻 😍😘
@Zhanx @e is awesome, but @th needs his #FrogPoints back! 
@Zhanx @ShannonMontague Tequila is for lust...
@Zhanx @support http://sli.mg/QQjOcz  something is leaking
@Zhanx @th #GreekToMe do you mean  just basically taking away the points by down voting ? But doing it through a "glitch" ? That's how I'm thinking of it?? If that makes sense. 
@Zhanx Absolutely https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW-Dmd4fzZE
@Zhanx Ah no it's one of my favorite channels tho
@Zhanx Amen! If we only listen to people we agree with, we'll never sharpen ourselves and better understand why we disagree. #FreeSpeech and respect of free speech is the remedy for that.
@zhanx and my notifications are flooded so I can keep track of anything.
@Zhanx Apologies - I meant this one:  http://miiteducation.com/Home/WhyMiIT/tabid/55/Default.aspx  I can't see anything by just browsing under Student Services.
@Zhanx Apologies again - I see MIIT is a trade school, not a university.  This also means that MTU has a Safe Space... aaaand we're back to the drawing board.
@Zhanx at the moment in the beta it's possible but come a year when there's 1000s more on #Gab it won't.  No doubt apps would of rolled out long before.
@Zhanx But it will make you and me look like complete dicks on the public feed..  #LoadBalance in private is my best advice...
@Zhanx carry on patriot
@Zhanx could you pass that along? We need to keep our #BestGabbers Happy and fulfilled and #FullOfFrogPoints 🐸
@Zhanx Didn't mean to be vicious, just trying to help this person. Seriously.
@Zhanx give this a watch, it may be wots goin on.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUkj4h_Tq-0
@Zhanx Good :-)
@Zhanx Haha, there's always gotta be someone who stirs the pot. You add variety to the mix. If it wasn't for people like you we would all just sit in silence not talking about the important shit. 🌶 🌶 🌶
@Zhanx I always told my children that sometimes certain people need a little extra help doing certain things. That everyone is different, but that is okay. Because if we were all alike, then the world would be boring. Also, that deep down inside, we are all the same, with the same feelings. 😂 
@Zhanx I didn't get chance to see them except one which was a like
@Zhanx I think so, it may be a script doing this.
@Zhanx I thought it was a viagara flash back...whew!
@Zhanx I'll definitely consider though.  Thanks for the feedback.
@Zhanx I'm guessing half at most will be regular users, the rest will stay on twitter until forced off by others leaving.
@Zhanx I'm probably heading for 6-700 downvotes now and I have 2300+ posts
@Zhanx I'm really not bothered, I'll earn plenty more and really they are just a bunch of pixels on a screen.
@Zhanx If we could dm I'd send you something to make you laugh, I might find you on twitter later.
@Zhanx isn't that going to cut into the YouTube profit stream if the indies all pick up and knave? 
@Zhanx it's happening to @Bro as well
@Zhanx known bug, we are working on it
@Zhanx leave even
@Zhanx Maybe... 
@Zhanx Morning, it's just the usual crap..
@Zhanx negative attention it feeds me
@Zhanx No prob! 😀 
@Zhanx No worries will send a dm later, you'll probably laugh.
@Zhanx No, I mean @pikari might be using a script from the speed, really not sure.
@Zhanx Not a sneak preview, it'll be a full fledged thing
@Zhanx Ooh thanks!
@Zhanx pics or it didn't happen!
@Zhanx really? Crazy how you perceive people differently behind a screen. #ImOld but maybe it's just that I don't grasp #HackerLifeTerms ???
@Zhanx Sometimes you wish you could tell that because "Life isn't fair", but don't do that. They'll find that out soon enough as they get older. Just stress that on the inside, we are the same. Point out that there all tall and short people, dark hair vs. blonde hair. etc. Differences everywhere.
@Zhanx support gets alot of requests for help :) i go through each an every one
@Zhanx thank you for a well defined explanation. 😍 #SimplifyForOldPeople 😆
@Zhanx thank you for helping, I am clueless about this stuff. #GabMomProblems 
@Zhanx The guidelines are so vague that they can literally silence anything. 
@Zhanx Ubuntu is so boss like that 
@Zhanx We need a free speech tube site! We can't replace that kind of revenue without such a large audience, but #freedom has to start somewhere
@Zhanx Yeah, and we could always find some random video hosting site, but I think one centered around free speech, like gab is doing in this medium, means we know from the start our free speech is respected
@Zhanx yeah, have a branch for unicodes but still not ready to deploy 🙁 
@Zhanx yep, essentially everyone gets screwed. 
@Zhanx yes that must be the difference. I am more on the social end of computers. #BabyFace gotta stay young any way you can! 🙃
@Zhanx Yes, I said don't do that. 😂 They will find out eventually on their own. Just point out that there are differences in everyone. Kind of like it isn't a big deal, so he won't focus on it. Meaning, those differences don't define us inside. 😂

After listening to Trump's immigration speech, I am feeling pretty good after all. 
After shagging a girl I met in the pub, she rolled over and panted, "Wow, that was great. I can tell you've used that thing before." I said, "Nah, just twice." Shocked, she asked, "You've only had sex twice?" I replied, "Sorry, I thought you were talking about the condom."

All it needs is more customization, photo/video sharing, people showing up when you start mentioning someone and more diverse opinions. Then sone shitposting and memes and it's perfect!
All the pundits angry about #TrumpSpeech have this in common: they drop his use of "illegal" every single time. Otherwise, he can't be whatever '-obic/-ist' they try to call him. Pro-tip: illegal = criminal

Also I love the frog at the top instead of G A B.
also it would be amazing if you can see how many people reposted your gab @support
Also what the freak youtube? #Gab couldn't have come at a more opportune time. People may think that starting a social media site based on free speech is immature or unnecessary but daily Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook prove them wrong. #Gab could be the savior of the internet. 
Also! Wanted to say, I had plans that were Friday AND Saturday that I don't have any longer, so I'm taking the time to work extra on recording some material :D 
Also, every fucking election there's people who say "if [so-and-so] wins I'm moving to (country--probably Canada)."   GUESS WHAT. YOU CAN'T JUST FUCKING PICK UP AND MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WILLY-NILLY. YOU NEED A JOB AND SPONSORSHIP. OR LOTS OF MONEY. YOU'RE AN IDIOT.   #TrumpLive #MAGA #GabFam

Also, the BWOT (Big Wall of Trump) serves as a demonstration: it is a mighty obstacle which shows that those who wish to attempt to enter the US nonetheless are part of a much weaker civilisation. It's a mark of greatness: "we're so powerful and attractive that we have to preserve ourselves"
Also, who told you that Marxists and trannies are NOT acting in their own self interest? It seems like it is exactly what they're doing. The point of distinction is wherever their self interest correlates with good for society/species.

Artists amongst the new Gabbers, please #introduceyourselves. #GabArt #ArtistsofGab
As #TedCruz said, “We must keep the internet free: free of taxes, free of regulation, and free of censorship." https://t.co/uxBQw9zHgo
As a devout #Catholic ...  This pisses me off....   http://www.weaselzippers.us/292719-pope-says-global-warming-is-a-sin-against-creation/
as a group only men pay taxes https://nkilsdonkgervais.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/research-finds-that-the-state-is-entirely-funded-by-male-taxpayers/
As an #aside I've never seen such hostility for saying Welcome to someone before. Oh well.
As censorship grows across all social media, people look for an alternative. That alternative is #Gab.
As evident in this compilation of the misdeeds and intolerable acts from the world's most notorious "religion of peace." #IslamIsCancer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ-QX8LuKHA  
As I got into some newer Japanese bands, like Destrose, Doll$Boxx, and Aldious one thing comes to mind. There must be a mandatory rule for them. The bassist has to be really cute.  Your move American and European Metal scene. Lets see you churn out a cute all girl metal act.
As I say to folks, "I'm not making fun of you, the fun is already there. I'm just pointing it out."
As me and the wife headed off on a romantic holiday we talked about what kinky things we'd like to do to each other. She said, "I've always wanted to be handcuffed." So I planted a kilo of coke in her suitcase.
As much as I agree, Trump would never say that. He's to much of a white knight.
As much as I hate Nickelback, we DO need a HERO!  And they say that a hero could save us I'm not gonna stand here and wait I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles Watch as we all fly away  #Trump #MAGA #GabFam #SpeakFreely
As my #GAB bio states "If you know me from Twitter: Robbin_Young you know my political & religious beliefs. FYI: I'm here to talk Politics, NOT about my Tits & Ass!" Thank you for listening & I look forward to interacting with the #GabFam.
As soon as #GAB allows image uploads and goes public, I'll be here a lot more. As soon as they create an official mobile app, I will be deactivating my Twitter.
As soon as the iOS app turns up, me and Twitter are over!
As such, it makes perfect sense that it is at the core of Trump's campaign, the Wall is a proxy for the identity of White America. If he were to back down on that promise he would certainly lose msot of his credibility and sincere support.  #MAGA
ask me questions here https://curiouscat.me/raptros
Astounding how the MSM is claiming that #Trump is "easing up" on his policy while listening on his speech right now: I hear the exact opposite.  Quite brilliant: his solid fan base is happy b/c he is sticking to his guns and low-information undecideds are also happy because he seems more "moderate".
At least I know China/HK won't be bringing in throngs of Muslim refugees ever. And Chinese people are, like, "yeah, duh, why would we want to do that?" #MAGA
At least this is highly targeted and not a wide-sweeping "reparations" thing. As was said, they can do as they like. I can appreciate the idea of making atonement for past sins, but it's not like Georgetown is a real Catholic institution or anything.
Aussie equivalent of #BritFam "stiff upper lip"  "keep your dick up"
Aw crap. I was trying to test out the new button (I guess it's to report or something?) and I can't unclick it.

Dear @pikari: As long as you scrolling through and downvoting all 94 of my #Gab posts, can you lick out any crusties you find in my asshole? I barely even pass a rag thru there anymore, but since you are so interested in my nether regions, can you…aaah…that's it…right there…there's a good dog.
Dear idiot citizen, if a police detective calls your phone, he/she will leave a message. if there is no message, it is most likely a wrong number. Asking for the "white sounding guy" is a building where one hundred people work will not get you very far. Regards, the po-po.
Dear President Trump,  Can I interest you in the low-cost alternative of anti-personnel mines?
Dear:  #MAGA  #BuildThatWall  #TrumpLive   I ask you, how tall will "Trump Wall" be? 10 feet tall? 100 feet? 1000 feet? 10,000?

Donald Trump goes to Mexico   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7xY_kX3wQc
Donald Trump has done more press conferences in Mexico than Hillary Clinton has done in the United States. #DeepThoughts #TrumpLive
Donald Trump has shown time and again that he cares about all citizens equally, because he doesn't view Americans as a nebulous collection of various identity blocs. Hillary Clinton's sole campaign tactic is to create ethnic and racial division.
Donald Trump held a press conference in Mexico, then did a rally in Arizona... all in one day.  Meanwhile, Hillary can barely give one 20 minute speech.
Donald Trump is a buffoon.
Donald Trump is currently the only person who can fix our country. He knows what needs to be done and he will not hesitate to act. We need a real leader, not a globalist puppet like Obama. #EndGlobalism
Donald Trump just released names of who he will appoint to his cabinet. Pictured below.   https://i.sli.mg/hjrkmS.jpg

Embarrassing to see @LaurenSouthern branded a racist by Kay Burley.  The vast amount of ignorant people jumping to Kay's defence is equally embarrassing, it shows they haven't taken the time to find out who Lauren is, but hear "Trump Supporter" and assume racist. A sad day for UK freedom of speech.

First member of #GabFam posting from Huntersville. 
First of all, Hillary has LITERALLY played the "im a woman" card TO MANY TIMES!. Calling herself a feminist when using her gender to promoter herself isnt equality, its the exact opposite. feminism is equality between BOTH sexes, not making one have more power cause the other one used to have more.
First the coffee, then the killing.  I mean knitting. Shut up.
First, because the Right is much more diverse than the Left and as such, is prone to division on issues such as economics, gender roles, structure of government etc.  Secondly, because the Right is elitist and has historically struggled with mass politics and mediatic seduction as a raison d'être
Fish Oil is great when you have squeaky fish.

Good God Trump sounds more Presidential every day! I am SO positive and happy and am so looking forward to 8 years of Trump as our President! #MAGA #TrumpLive #GabFam #Gab #Trump 
Good God! Their grandmothers have taken over!  Actually, it's women who have taken over.  It's women who can't handle mean speech.  My wife refuses to follow me cause I'm too snarky.  In the internet, that's their problem.
Good Grief.  This guy has the personality of a wet mop.  He looks like the guy who ate flies in the high school cafeteria. And not biased at all...right?  http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/01/matt-lauer-host-first-trump-clinton-forum/

Good Morning!
Good Morning, #GabFam.  Let's make it a great day.
Good night #gabfam I can't wait until I start working normal hours again so I can continue our traditional family of wife husband and child that is one of 2 genders, happens to be a girl; this declaration will surely piss off the sjw lesbians and other unmentionables.

Goodnight #Gabbers, I'll be back in a couple hours. (@WRM and I had our third child on the 5th. Lots of middle of the night wake ups.)  It was nice talking to a bunch of you today. Any of you feel free to say hello. I'd love to talk to you even if we don't agree on everything.  #Gab #SpeakFreely

HA! GAAAAAAYYYY!  #GabQueers #SaySomethingOffensive
Had another brilliant brainstorm for a new #Gab feature. Create a 'boss troll' account for each hashtag. It posts 22 times per min. If we can downvote a boss to zero faster than it upvotes itself, every participant gets a running OCD Bonus of +5-5+5-5+5.
Hah I wonder what this platform would be like if you blocked the word "Gab"  #GabFam

Haram Gives Allah A Bad Name #MakeASongIslamic
Harambe was entirely innocent. It was the fault of the corrupt Democrat Cleveland government that lead to the unfortunate and untimely death of a  proud young African-American. #MAGA #Trump #Trump2016 
Has #GeraldoRIvera gotten anything right?!?  Ever?!?
Has anyone said "YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS" on #Gab yet? Well... YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS.
Have any of the cool kids on #twitter arrived to #Gab already? 
Have you ever heard someone say "most fights end up on the ground."  Well I am in the midst of a large research project and it turns out that that statement is not true!  
Have you ever noticed that https://s14.postimg.org/yasj1y5ep/14188421_10157272568010577_6866773441470026308_o.jpg
Haven't been on much downloading videos from Youtube before they are pulled....
Having a Blast(!!) #MakeASongIslamic
He committed Haram. But what do I know I'm kicking it Jahilliyyah with everyone else in the west that is obsessed by multiculturalism and pronouns. 
He put parody in the bio @support 
He SAID IT!!!   #BuildTheWall #TrumpLive
He stood at the superbowl so go figure he makes a statement  when he's shit...  or maybe he's too used to having his entitled ass planted on the bench.
He was the guy with the live-in girlfriend or the common law wife or whatever she was, and he casually reached out and stroked my hairy arm and said, apropos of nothing, "We haven't even had sex yet."  The needle on the record scratched and I looked at his wife and she just smiled at me.  Yup. ...
He who needs no title, Donald of House Trump!  #TrumpLive #Arizona #Mexico #Illegals 
He's attracting a whole new demographic of endorsers…  https://twitter.com/TheSibylSpeaks/status/770750284205359108
he's clearly an atheist aka satan. 
He's probably an SJW, the only operable mental facilities they appear to possess is the persistence in spewing dimwitted insults.  By the way:  *I* offer you a warm welcome!  😀 
Hear about the 2 men from the monastery who opened up a fast food seafood restaurant? One was the fish friar and the other was the chip monk
Hearing all these people lose their loved ones just breaks my heart.  :(  #TrumpLive

Here's an easy-to-use response for all of the pointless "This sounds just like Jeb! or Rubio" bullshit that will be incoming after Trump's immigration speech:  WAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL  #Trump #MAGA
Here's an idea, keep the Muslims in their shitty countries instead of bringing them here. Then we can help them fix their shitty countries and bring them into the 21st country. They are literally cave-people with some modern technology, but nearly no knowledge.

Hi! Nice platform! I'm glad to see options opening up. To #introduceyourself myself, I don't usually offend anyone, but I do like to create representational art, which does seem to offend some people. OH MY GOD! I can write more?! It's like being let out of prison.

Hmm, now that I think about, I never came up with a name for my webcomic (Naming stuff is something I've always struggled with). #GabFam, can you guys lend me a hand and help me come up with name for a #Gab webcomic?

Honestly I would rather he go to NJPW and eventually form his own heel faction like AJ Styles did. WWE is no longer be all end all of wrestling. Companies not named TNA actually have good talent that gets booked right.

How many times after a #Trump speech, especially a major policy speech, have you ever seen the media not relentlessly attack him the next day (yet).  Goddamn this speech was great! #MAGA  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8froy8bbzlY
How old is Rudy?
How the fuck does the media STILL not understand what Trump means when he says that Mexico will pay for the wall? They are LITERALLY acting as if we expect Mexico to cut a check, I don't think anybody in the world believes that. How dumb do they think we are? #MAGA #Trump

However plain his language and meaning, detractors of #Trump are going to twist his words in the worst way possible.  With the latest breathless reporting on the "alt-right", they're twisting the words and misrepresenting the actions of his supporters as well.

I believe that, with multiple reforms weaved together & legislatively inseparable, the right matrix of action could make everyone win.  Sadly we have a national culture and Congress that makes such "blanket reform packages" impossible, and the SCOTUS would separate & crush specific parts anyway.
I bet the #racebaiters at @CNN weren't expecting a well informed #Mexican #American, so they had to cancel him: http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=35549
I buried my last girlfriend beside the fish farm.  The sniffer dogs'll never find her there.
I call to motion that the term hashtags be changed to #Gabtags, anyone else here agree? #Gab #GabFam
I came here to #MAGA and #shitpost and #SpeakFreely, and there doesn't seem to be any brakes.
I can attest to low sugar.  I went on sort of a paleo diet on advice from my chiropractor and it basically healed the inflammation in my gut and leg.  I also lost a lot of weight, a bad side effect for me but great for others.
i can end that tbh @Greta333 
I can hear those kicks from here. And this was a pre tape  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
I can usually judge how attractive a woman is by how many times my wife calls her a whore.
I can't believe how tied up I am with this election. I check r/the_donald at least hourly. Drudge just as often. I'm more invested than I was with Ron Paul. I'm thankful that college ball is starting back up so I can take a breath. Anyone else a CFB fan? #GoNoles 
I can't believe my ears. The Young Turks just called #Trump 'nimble' for visiting Mexico.
I can't handle all the winning from today guys, I'm going to bed: https://i.sli.mg/GGsSh0.jpg #MAGA #Trump #GabFam #Gab 
I can't help but think the Georgia Association of Broadcasters is peeved right now. #mistakenidentity
I can't seem to upload a banner picture. So you can just pretend that's a very angular pixilated picture of me. 
I can't support somebody who takes money from nations that would kill me for my sexuality.  #GabQueers #CrookedHillary #FuckTheSaudis
I can't tell you how refreshing it is to be on social media with some like minded individuals.
I can't wait for polls! #Gab
I cannot find an answer for anything I ask myself 
I cannot wait until Trump's energy steamrolls Sick Hillary at the debates. #MAGA #TrumpLive #ImWithered
I constantly hear, "You can't be a Christian, and pose for nude photos." Pfffttt! lol Well, I'm a Southern Baptist, who was baptized by Billy Graham, and I allow NO one to judge me but God!
I could do with a coffee, thanks to all those trying to help out, I was a bit stressed.
I dated another one at 16 yrs old.."whoda thought"
I decided to drown my sorrows in booze. And gambling. I somehow ended up with this guy. I feel like if it's appropriate to name him after a rather famous and witty drunk. #PokemonUranium #Gaming #PC https://i.sli.mg/evSfZa.png
I did engineering 15 years ago and they had "Queer safe spaces" etc then.  Even to an 18 year old the whole thing seemed stupid #GabSquad
I did enjoy the trolling by Canada's interim Conservative Party leader, Rona Ambrose. #CurrentYear  http://www.chatelaine.com/living/politics/rona-ambrose-trolls-justin-trudeau/
I did get a bit twitchy when the people were talking about Skyrim and had never heard of Morrowind, so I get it.
I didn't have to post nudes to get 116 followers, but I would have stood on a corner and gave everyone free hugs if needed. Thank you to everyone who chose to do so. You guys are awesome!  http://i.giphy.com/l46C8niNgpzovmhpK.gif #Gab #GabFam #GIFWAR
I didn't realize that Catholics were a swing group that was dissected as much as this article on NR spells out.  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439526/donald-trump-catholic-voter-problem?utm_source=NR&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=August31desanctis
I didn't think I'd like this song, but eh, I did. #GabMusic
I discovered Minds.com today. Haven't heard of it before, though it has existed for longer than #Gab. It has had a bit longer to develop. Also promising, though it will take me time to learn how to use it. Gab is dynamic and has intuitive design. Do you have any thoughts on Minds, fellow Gabbers? 
I discuss Japan's population problem. I get called a racist.
I do like that gab.ai has a much more forgiving character limit. It may be just me but it's sometimes difficult to restrain yourself within that 140 character limit. 
I do love how some idiots claim Cartoons and Anime are the same thing, because the Japanese call them cartoons. They also call Manga, comics over there. And we all know Manga is vastly different than what we call comics.
I don't get how people can eat that stuff daily. 
I don't have any more fluid left....  #Trump
I don't have time to tag all the awesome people. Click on the people I follow and follow all of them because they're awesome.  #Gabfam
I don't know if roasting things over a fire is considered cooking, but there's a clear designation in my house.  Wife: cooks (she's good at it and I'm not) Husband: cleans (He's good at it and she's not... as good). Husband: grills, because FIRE!!!! Wife: Husband cleans. Look above! Husband: Dammit!
I don't know whether it is now or whether it always was and I just didn't see it. I like to think the former but fear the latter.
I don't know why people get so pissed off about Burkas.  Are they not just like portable Glory-Holes?
I don't know you well yet,but rest assured,I make my own opinions,& do not base them on anyone else bull shit.
I don't try to do #controversial. I try to do #Honest I don't mind an Intellectual fight, but you'd better be right! Or I'll take your logic apart!  I look forward to any intellectual battle you may care to enter with me.  After all, isn't this ALSO what the social networks should be about?  Well @a
i don't want to further trigger @killary_Clinton so i will no longer assume its identity, and will refer to it as 'it'. #tolerance
I don't watch new movies the way I used to. Either I'm getting old or Hollywood hasn't been bringing the juice.
I eat ass. ;)
I encourage @JudicialWatch 2 prove Hillary's "pay-for-play" by using "no-pay-gets-no-play" as support. Example: Mexico paid zero & got no favors.  If JW can prove that no one, who SHD have gotten attention and meetings, got NONE, if they did not pay the Clinton Foundation, that supports the PFP case
I encourage all new members of the #GabFam to #IntroduceYourself so we can get to know you better.  For my part I meme, I'm an English student who loves cooking, gaming and history. Support my political career with upfrogs, 1 frog = 1 pray = 1 like = 1 vote.
I fantasize about Alex Jones. 
I fear for my right to #speakFreely on #YouTube. I'm not big in subscribers, but seeing what content gets demonetised, I wonder when it will hit in Germany. What do you think, #GabFam?
I feel like an explorer cautiously wading through a swamp hoping to find someone I recognize! And I've got almost 200 characters left.
I feel lIke I'm the only one getting it? Like everyone I hangout with and live around just isn't getting it and is fine with a shitty life
I feel like my internal clock will wake me up tomorrow for school. Which would suck. Since I don't have school tomorrow because of #TropicalStorm #Hermine  #HurricaneSeasonIsTheOnlyTimeWeGetDaysOffOfSchool #YayForFloridaLiving #ReallyLongHashtags  #TropicalStormHermine
I feel like they're holding back. But even still, it's going to be a hard match to follow    #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
I feel like we need a #SJW4PIPA hashtag. #SpeakFreely #GabFam #Gab
I feel pregnant 
I feel the same way about Nigel. #Brexit #BritFam  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc1RnUS0cSM
I find individualism suffers from a lack of advocates. Frequently people who think this way will lie about it or disguise it as it will hurt themselves. Indeed taking a stupid stand is in direct conflict with the idea. That does NOT mean it isn't possible to show our ideas are better and we should
I find it interesting that advertisers will willingly associate their brands with sites like Gawker, but when it comes to certain YouTubers, they're now quick to pull out.
I find it rather curious that Youtube started their purge of monetized content right after the #CONLeaks happened.
I find myself on The_Donald so much less now that we have #Gab. What the hell has happened to me?? 
I followed @e - I feel like I am now communing with Hal from the movie 2001 A Space Oddessy #GabFam #Gab
I followed you harder, hope it helps. 
I forgot his name. 
I forgot how sexy social media could be when it's not so social. #gab
I forgot the creepy cathedral near Prague that's made out of human bones... 
I found a #RareGabby inside the green bell pepper I cut up this evening for our salads. (I added the eyes.) https://sli.mg/LZBT11
I get on #Gab so much more than Twitter now. Like not even that interested in Twitter. I see posts from people I know and see the news. After that, it's pretty boring. 
I got a Trump vid coming right up...let the Landslide begin
I guess I earned a short break, then it's back to my art creation station. #ArtistsLife #GabArt #GabFam #Gab #MyArt
I guess it depends upon the stranger...  http://www.ted.com/talks/kio_stark_why_you_should_talk_to_strangers?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_campaign=daily&utm_medium=email&utm_content=image__2016-08-31
I guess it's an unwritten law of the universe that these things have to have cucked-out, BettyCo™ names.

I guess there's probably a bunch of my followers who never saw my old #IntroduceYourself so I'll do a new one. Hi! I'm Roberto! I love pizza, wings, and posting gifs with my #GabFam I love discussions of any kind and believe wholly in #FollowForFollow
I HAD IT 
I had sex with this girl I met in the pub. After I came, I pulled out and said, "Oh no, the condom split." "For fuck's sake," she yelled. "How could this happen?" I replied, "I don't know. I've only used it twice."
I hate it when people say "Oh, I'm a vegetarian except for fish".  Yeah? And I'm a non-smoker except for cigarettes.
I hate Muslims I won't use your pronouns Illegal immigration must be stopped I'm gay myself but I hate people who act flamboyant I will never respect SJW views Trump will be a great president I don't get offended by your opinions And you shouldn't get offended by mine. #SaySomethingOffensive #MAGA  
I hate sites like Polygon and Kotaku... I wonder underneath their "Social Justice" BS there's an element of Racism contained within..?  http://heatst.com/tech/polygon-and-social-justice-warrior-hatred-of-japanese-games-is-basically-imperialism/
i hate women and i want them to die #ReasonsToBeatYourGF 
I have a concept for a package of reform that would achieve a lot of objectives for both the left and the right that would result in the US and Mexico having both a wall and a relationship akin to that between the UK and France.  It reads like a Trump x Nieto fanfiction. It also won't happen.
i have a feeling that youtube guidelines are fucked up... i have no idea why  http://imgur.com/a/xt6ue #GabFam 
I have a new profile pic up. This is how I imagine myself after coffee.
I have a personal workout plan for most days.  For example I commit to doing 800 sit ups and 500 pushups per week along with some other stuff.  What about everyone else?  #workout
I have a plan. Let's get as many people possible together, head to the California border, form a long line along it, sit down, dig our heels in and collectively push. 
I have a tender heart for what I call "throw away children".  Been bringing them home for decades.  Even brought one sailor home from boot camp.  No one wanted him.  I am not afraid to speak up for them!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTZ5VpfzoW0
i have always wanted a view counter for my tweets, so why not my gabs? @support
i have been living a mistake for 6 years
I have brain damage and care more about money than anything else.  #ImWithHillary
I have found something peculiar when reading Pierre Bourdieu`s Introduction To Reflexive Sociology. Namely, in the chapter V: Language, gender and symbolic violence. (title already suggests what kind of stuff to expect seeing in it, especially provided that you know bourdieu`s philosophical history)
I have magical powers. One 500 error when I sign on this the morning, checked again, and then **poof** #Gab is back up and running!  #Gab #GabFam #SpinklesPixieDust
I have never been, wanted to steam up the coast in a friend's freighter to lanse aux meadows and check out the Viking settlement, just havent made it yet.  Canada is a really big fucking place🐸👍👍
I have no idea how gifs work on this thing.
I have no problem w/enforcing our immigration laws. The law is the law.  I DO have a problem w/demonizing the people who come here illegally
I have recently discovered coconut oil too! It is great for everything! Great moisturizer for entire body, especially feet. Anti-fungal, so fights off "athlete's foot" if you go to gyms, etc. Also, great as foot moisturizer for diabetics too - helps with nerve damage.  #NutritionTips
I have seen some #Gabbers talk about email notifications. I haven't received a single one, other than the signup link (if that counts). I don't know if this is a bug or acting as intended (beta limitation), my settings are all turned on.   FYI, @support.
I have successfully redpilled my friends at Uni with nothing but logic.
I have to leave you today, #Phoenix, but I'll be back.   #GreatTimes 
I haven't been active on Facebook or twitter for weeks now all thanks to r/the_Donald and #GAB
I haven't bought it yet but I have the PSP Project DIVA games and Project DIVA f on the Vita. Great games, going to be importing Diva X soon.
I haven't paid attention to #GeraldoRivera since Al Capone's vault. Is anyone still listening to him?
I heard someone say it was case sensitive.  Try adding it all uppercase, then all lowercase, and then finally first letter uppercase with the rest lowercase.  See if that helps.  :)
I hereby tag @Furrrealz @0 and @Captricksky to post #SchoolOfGab entries
I highly doubt it's a coincidence that YouTube's attempt to discourage people to #SpeakFreely to appease advertisers happened the day before the last fiscal quarter. 
I hope @a & @Support are working on a feature to send 120volts to anyone that clicks that report icon!! lmao The Trolls will love that button! We're all ecstatic to have #Gab! If you see something you don't like, keep scrollin! THAT is what adults do! ;)  #SaySomethingOffensive #SpeakFreely #GabFam
I hope beardson beardy doesn't come on here. I hate that faggot 
I hope that this platform stays true to the uncensored ideal. At first, Twitter held itself out as a proponent of free speech; But the bigger it grew the more it distanced itself from that idea.
I hope the #Gab team has groups or communities planned.   I seriously want to start a #CoffeeEnthusiast group. And a #Whisky group, and #Audiophile, #BBQ, #Watches, #2A, oh fuck that list is going to be long.  I'm so ready to dump every other freedom obstructing social media.
I hope when the apps for GAB come out @m is more active! <3 
I just followed the white rabbit @shell
I just noticed you can't attach images to posts. @a
I just realised @a reposted one of my posts. Does this mean I'm famous now?
I kind of like the idea of Gab becoming a conservative/moderate/classically liberal bastion since it'll be filled with Twitter expats.
I knew there was a reason I hated dropbox.  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach  #hacking #Gab
I know Hillary is the spawn of Satan, but this Trump circle jerk is ridiculous 
I know I am always the one with the ever-flowing sappy posts.  But  Please tell me the rest of you have noticed the amazing, talented, funny, intelligent people that make up this community? Am I the only one who thinks this is the greatest place and not because my son runs it.  #FromTheHeart #GabFam
I know it was disturbing to see the same post for each repost in your feed. Now it's fixed.  Enjoy   #gabchangelog
I know that if I was running a book promotion and if there was a Spoiler feature that I could track, I would post a gab with a promo code  hidden in the spoiler.  And being able to track the number of engagements to view my promo code would be powerful and effective. 
I know this platform is an "everyome invited" thing, but I just asked someone on FB to defend their position on college rape culture and got the "I dont have time for this" shtick. Just looked - deleted.   I can't bring myself to invite those people because they would get eaten alive here.   #Gab
I legitimately feel bad when I cannot Gab all day. It's been stressing me out today. lol
I LIKE ATTENTION TOO *HINT* *HINT* =D
I like the Dutch. They sound drunk to German ears.
I like the increased character limit here. ☺
I like the sound #gab makes when I get notifications 🐸 🐸 
I like the way #Bearing talks.  https://youtu.be/Sl1dX6uZq9I
I like those pro-Trump black chicks, Diamond and Silk. Unfortunately I had to have my attorney send them a cease and desist letter. Diamond and Silk are what I had my balls named. #MAGA #RIPHarambe  https://i.sli.mg/eCB8mG.jpg
I like to wear a burka when I'm on the tube.  It's the best way to get a seat.
I love beating my wife #Myfirstpost
I love being white. #SaySomethingOffensive
I love feeling good.
I love Giuliani's energy: He would have made an excellent Commander-In-Chief  #TrumpLive
I love how I'm never in a #favoritegabbers list.. ::okay::
I love it here. ❤️  #Gab #GabFam
I love my #American holidays because we get the whole family together. My #GabFamily is also invited.   You all smell WONDERFUL
I love that #Make2016Worse is trending on Twitter...  #Make2016Worse? How can it get any worse Ellen? We're at the threshold of hell!    #ChevyChase #ChristmasVacation
I love the #TrumpLive trend, it gave me a heads up to watch his speech
I love the entire production of the #CWC from the sports style broadcasting and bracket analysis to the video packages introducing the competitors, to the constant match of the year candidates  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
I love the fact that there is a social network where people can agree to disagree and everyone be in favor for each other's freedom of speech. #GabFam 
I love the Show Silicon Valley. Let's help the little guy that wants free speech from the evil Hooli (Google). #SpeakFreely
I love the smell of #GabFam in the morning.
I love this fucking dog, man #blackdogsmatter https://i.sli.mg/5tVUuO.jpg
I love you, #Phoenix. 
I loved Trump's speech. Hillary must looks really bad now that Trump is advertising hugely his support for mexicans. Now Hillary looks like the Racist! 
I made a mistake on twitter,  I mixed family with strangers. I intended to use twitter as an anonymous account of my life. I hope I'm welcome to just be me here?
I made a video to set the record straight on Trump once and for all. Stop calling him a racist libertards, this is coming from a Hispanic. Enjoy. Please subscribe xD. I'm getting a really good mic soon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQE4d7_YY-Y #Trump #MAGA #Gab #Speakfreely #SaySomethingOffensive
I made chicken and waffles once. Neither my wife or kids understood what was supposed to be so special about it. Frankly, neither did I.  But we like Chicken and we like Waffles, so no big loss.
I made this 'shop of Donald way back on Slaughter Tuesday (March 1st, 2016). Finally got around to updating it with the broken banner of #CrookedHillary    https://i.sli.mg/yQ45V9.png  #Trump #MAGA
I mainly wanna do it on lesser known nintendo games
I married a child and I liked it.   #MakeASongIslamic
I may be the minority here, but I think Liberalism is lazy. 
I might adjust my Gab a little later. Might just use my real name and stuff since I don't have to deal with BLM death threats or job threats.
I might come visit America for his inauguration. Would be a blast #MAGA
I missed this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIBV1IciLl8  #TitanQuest #Gaming
I must be psychic. Just yesterday morning or perhaps the day before, I was muttering to myself and throwing my hands up in the air that all I wanted to do in the beginning was get high-profile enough and ring the right alarm bells and then more competent authorities would fix the problem. But no,...
I must have triggered poor little @killary_Clinton. he/it is on a downvote rampage. 
I named my car Merkel (cause it's German) and today I am going to ride the shit out of this bitch!
I named my left tit Allahu and the right Akbar, because they make people go crazy. #SaySomethingOffensive 
i need fucking followers, let me just say some edgy shit and use all the #'s to abuse the system   "i hate black people"  #SaySomethingOffensive #GabFam #MAGA #Gab #SpeakFreely #Trump #NutritionTips #introduceMyself #Hilary #gabchangelog
I need some general joe's 
I need to be a better #Gabber.   Need to post more interesting things.    
I need to change computers this chromebook isn't cutting it right now.
I need to wear the shirt when I get on social media outside of Gab and see all of the censoring that happens. http://filthytokyo.com/products/mens-premium-t-shirt-9
I never cared for how many follow me, but it always makes me happy to see the email from gab notifying me of a new follower.  #GAB
I never give numerical scores, but stay tuned for the review! Working on the video...
I once ate a Double-down from KFC. It really wasn't very good but I don't regret it.  
I once went to lunch with a black co-worker. We had a really nice lunch & had a some good laughs. Upon walking back to my car she notice I had a "O-shit" sticker on my car like the "W-the president" stickers. She called HR to complain: she felt she was in a "hostile environment" on the ride back...
I open ONE door, TWICE to let my dog out and inside, and seventeen flies come into my house. FRICK.
I plan to open a Comedy Club which will also include Prostitutes!  I shall call it 'BROFL'
I play the cowbell in #theband. #TheBand
I prefer right-wing "hate" to left-wing "tolerance."   #RealTalk #SpeakFreely 
I propose we starte a #cringe hashtag where we can post whatever cringe we find.   I'll start with miss/mister/Xin/Pan/Bun Biogender  https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14233134_1760168644231613_7788319191349546575_n.jpg?oh=e30a7924d7ef3f2c769ea58b311cc99a&oe=58815C0C
I rapped you. It was me. I would have made Nixon proud. I changed 1261 to 1216. It was me. It all went down exactly like you said. I mean, exactly. I doctored the copies, I paid the kid at the shop to lie for me. It is insane how you got every detail exactly right.   #BetterCaulSaul
I read the instructions on my suppositories:  Insert 2" up anus. Keep out of reach of children.  Think I'll do 3" to be on the safe side.
I really am starting to question some of the accounts on here. Are they impersonating or are they legit iconic people...?
I really despise that man.
I remember Twitter used to suffer from "Nada Capacidad" all the time... No big deal  #ItsGabbening
I saw that @Caro. Trying to update your profile text by posting a Gab ;) You should see the things I have accidentally typed in the Facebook post box. #GabFam.
I saw this during the primaries, once #Trump starts building momentum he accelerates into orbit, the same time, Clinton is burning through the atmosphere.  Very high energy Such #YUGE Strength of #TenOxen #TrumpLive #MAGA
I say #MAGA on behalf of all cuckolds
I see a lot of people mentioning Minds.com now that #YouTubeIsOverParty But people seem to have forgotten about Liveleak.com. Why not utilize that, since it already has a community?
I see an opportunity to sell authentic-appearing documentation for underperforming students:  http://washington.cbslocal.com/2016/09/01/georgetown-to-give-slave-descendants-priority-for-admission/
I sell food to northern virginia, maryland, and dc. Personal Trainer on the side feel free to ask diet or exercise questions and check out my food www.mealdealers.com #introduceyourself
I shamelessly stole my username from a neologism created by Tom Simon.  His essay about superversion is worth your time: http://bit.ly/2bVbbaH  "[O]ur whole civilization is built on the courage of men and women who would not surrender to their circumstances, but strove for something better." 
I should go for a job with Lonely Planet, "Why You Should Take A Staycation"
I should update my info 
I sincerely hope Trump wins #SaySomethingOffensive
I so want a gab.ai t-shirt, is dat possible? @a
I still don't like Mike Pence imo. He seems like a decent guy but I don't agree with his politics.
I suggest listening to either Yakkity Sax or Stayin' Alive while watching so as to not depress you with what endgame globalism looks like.  http://magafeed.com/a-romantic-walk-through-paris/  #MAGA #BritFam #GodSaveTheQueen
I swear, I get a little bit more psyched every single time daddy speaks. #MAGA #TrumpLive
I tell jokes, but I don't believe any individual should be judged based solely upon race. Culture is a much greater factor in determining how someone will act.
I think "Airbus" is a more realistic term
I think @Callum died
I think I hurt @Ctomp513 feelings somehow.
I think I laughed to hard at this.  https://youtu.be/jXrsSGEvDf4
I think I may be the oldest person here.  #IntroduceYourself. 
I think I'm going to hit 300 Gabs today!
I think I'm going to really like #Gab. Almost wish I worked there.
I think I've seen more #Gabbers respectfully disagree about serious topics on #Gab than I've seen on other sites in... well, ever? #GabFam #SpeekFreely 
I think my new girlfriend's a bit of a slag.  I've just Googled 'the best things to do in Bangor', and her name came up.
I think once I hit 500 Gabis I'm going to give away a Tshirt.. thoughts?  WHOSE WITH ME? :)
I think President Trump really hit that immigration speech out of the park. Border control is great for Americans AND Mexicans in the long term. #Trump #MAGA 
I think pud posted this on fuckedcompany circa 2001. #GIFARMY https://i.sli.mg/CCcILY.gif
I think she learned it from old Hiden Biden  http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/31/hiding-hillary-day-270-trump-mexico-hillary-makes-rare-appearance/
I think the ref just gave the go home cue  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
I think we should refer to all thieves as "unauthorized appropriators". It's less offensive. #LiberalLogic
I think you're 100% right on this. It's why he needs to be as reasonable as he can, but forceful.
I thought Animated GIFs were dead... Like seriously - I only equate them with AOL and Compuserve.  But #Gab may be the only reason they survive and prosper.
I thought I was a regular American, but then I keep hearing "That is not who we are as a nation" so I'm trying to figure out when it changed.
I thought to myself "Man, this plane is rare" Then  I  thought "Nah man, fulfill Sharia law" "Go bomb in Tehran" I pulled up to the cell about 9:11 or later I looked at the driver and said "Allah hu akbar, madh Allah, yarzuqna"
I took a trip to the weird part of YouTube and discovered something.... GLORIOUS. https://youtu.be/6od76UNHt-M #Gab #GabFam #NSFW #Russia #WeirdGab #GlitterMunchkin
I tried to explain to my 3 year old (who attends pre-school) the concept of #homeschool: "Do you want to go to class with the other kids and play with them, or do you want to stay home and have mama be the teacher?" "Stay home" he said. Next day to his teacher: "I want to homeschool!" *embarassed*
I understand wanting an English dub for the upcoming BlazBlue game... but can we NOT say "I'll pay for it as DLC"? Don't replace bullshit with more bullshit, you fucking drones.  https://www.change.org/p/aksys-games-support-the-dub-for-blazblue-central-fiction?source_location=petitions_share_skip
i upvoted downvoted upvoted downvoted what did you get a notifcation?
I use #Gab because I hate women and niggers
I usually don't like rap too. Weird. 
I vote in favor of declaring use of the #TrumpLive hashtag for live Trump speeches, such as the one about to start this evening.  This way we can have a running dialog as Trump speeches are happening.
I voted begrudgingly for McCain and Romney and now all these cucks, you know who you are, are telling me Trump isn't presidential. 2 words. Suck it!
i wanna #MAGA, just not the way trump wants to...
I wanna be the writer 
I wanna die 
I want a fuck an anime character 
I want a tesla dude. They are so fucking dope
I want all my followers back right now!
i WANT MY FOLLOWERS BACK IVE HAD IT IM THROUGH PLAYING GAMES I WILL BLOCK PEOPLE ON GAB AND FIND OUT WHATS GOING ON HERE I WANT 300 FOLLOWE-
I WANT TO COME TO THE USA LEGALLY! 
I want to go to the SF 49er's game tonight just so I can boo Colin Kaepernick.  Stand up you spoiled brat. Your message would be better received if you united people with your protest method rather than disrespecting an entire country.
I want to punch the "My Pillow" guy in the face  #GabFam  OG
I want to try to go to the USA during Trump's SECOND TERM!
I wanted to do videos on the new community guidelines by breaking them in three languages. But then: https://twitter.com/xXxOPEXOBxXx/status/771250066367520768 So far it seems to be a bot doing all that demonetising and to me it looks shady to even want to tread the waters. 1/2 #GabFam #YouTube 
I warned that if the left continued in the way it has the far/alt right would rise up and do something. Hate to say I told you so.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/01/british-public-back-a-ban-on-burqa-by-two-to-one-poll-finds/
I was in the gym changing room when I saw a bloke watching me dry my bum. I warned my mate that there was a weirdo about. He said that maybe it was innocent and he was just waiting to use the hand dryers.
I was so pleased it was domestic violence week recently. I'd never tried it before. I really enjoyed it, the wife wasn't so keen.
I was standing to the left of my wife in the bar when I noticed a man pinch her right arse cheek. I would have gone over and said something, but it would've taken me ages getting there.
I was wondering if anyone missed me today? #DidYouMissMe #IHopeYouAllBehaved 
I went to a rave once, I'll never be the same.
I went to a really posh school. In fact, the school was so posh that the Gym was called James.
I will get #RIPBantu trending myself if I have to 
I will never get tired of #Trump rattling off endless wild promises and then leaving the stage to "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
I will say we went 0 to 100 real quick.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2bBZvSPpOo
I will stop apologizing for America and we will start celebrating America! #MAGA
I will try to get to you all, #GabFam. #TrumpLive fucked my shit up. #TheBand  https://i.sli.mg/WfI4ug.png

I wish I lived in a city that wasn't complete shit. I'm surprised I'm 1/4th normal growing up in this disgusting infestation of humans. I just want to move west or south already :(

I wrote a dissertation on food supply in Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, @C_ . The reports out of France have a striking similarity to the early days of that one; how can the Jordanian monarchy cope, but French Socialist Republic can't?  http://bit.ly/1WtuLwc
I'd have to find it (a Google search brings up results of nancies saying why we can't build one) there is an article discussing how the wall would be an investment by saving us billions in all the SNAP, Section 8 housing, education, health care etc given to illegal aliens that don't pay taxes.

I'll give gab.ai a go for a bit.  Twitter is BS, and always has been BS.  At least here since the community is small maybe i can make true meaningful connections into the AltRight. Minus any 1488ers.
I'm #Grateful to have meaningful work that I love!  The right job is critical for me.    I'm a programmer (specializing in UIX & Data Structures) and a direct care supervisor at a teenager rehab.  I enjoy my work so much that it has turned into play!  😀  #IntroduceYourself #GabFam

I'm going to be one of the writers for our PSU Trump group, but I'm still a part of the #GabFam . I'm a science kid who has never written before, now writing about my extreme alt right movement! (I am not a politician!) Do you guys like reading cordial diatribes or profanity-riddled truth-bombs?
I'm going to get to watch movies (FOR CREDIT) for this post-production class 😂 Best semester ever!

I'm just wondering who they're going to get to drive the van. #TheBand
I'm legitimately excited on how Gab will be developed, hopefully the media uploads are separated by type so my profile isn't fugly.
I'm missing big daddy trump, so y'all will have to hashtag the shit out of it so I can catch up later. 
I'm not 100% certain Facebook's intentions are completely sincere. India banned their attempt to "connect the world" because it involved foisting Facebook onto consumers while limiting access to competition (surprise).  http://www.wired.com/2016/02/facebooks-free-basics-app-is-now-banned-in-india/
I'm not a diva, who cares that I follow a limited amount of people. If you like what I have to say & you follow me...I'll follow you back, if we have similar points of view. If you're #ImWithHillary, please do NOT follow me!
I'm not lying. I'm just doing the Hillary Clinton.
I'm not saying my ex girlfriend is a slut but if all our cocks had wings, she'd be the bloody airport.
I'm not saying my new girlfriend's a bit of a slut.  But people keep writing "even my van's not as dirty as this", on her back.
I'm officially coming out of the closet as a Trump supporter. #MAGA #GabQueers

I'm planning on #LiveGabbing Trump's immigration speech, for shits and giggles.  Discussion / comments welcome.
I'm pregnant 
I'm pretty sure it's been scientifically proven #WomenofGab are prettier than leftists. I saw it published in Tendies: The Journal of Kek.
I'm really hoping #Trump brings 2 or 3 unopened pickle jars with him to the debate with Hillary coming up. 
I'm seriously impressed at the speed the @gab team [@e, @a] are rolling out features/changes/bugfixes. Great plans for world domination (api, photos, video, streaming, etc) too. #Gab #GabFam
I'm sick. When I was a kid I used to lie in bed and stare at the clock, now I lie in bed and stare at gab.   #ShareFreely
I'm slightly out of it right now, so I'll admit that you citizens of the USA on Gab have changed my mind on Hillary. She had a slight lead in my mind originally. I can now understand why you want Trump to be the next president and I hope you get your wish. I hope he lives up to your expectations. 
I'm so proud of #TheBand. Almost #1 trending. #GabFam

I'm worried there is no one on gab that will ever be outraged or offended by my opinion.

I've been arguing with this dude on facebook for a couple days now about police brutality & BLM.  Today I skimmed through his profile & found out he's a juggalo.  I was just like: http://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif  I'm not even going to bother anymore. 
I've been growing my own shit since birth and can confirm it tastes great, it tastes so good that I post it online almost constantly.

I've been needing some motivation recently. 
I've been trying to come up with an original joke about sluts,  but they've all been done countless times.  just like yo mama!
I've had more interactions/engagements in the last hour with one past than I have in the last few months on Twitter. @a you're obviously doing something right #GabFam
I've had sex with my new girlfriend in lots of exciting places.  Sadly, her anus isn't one of them.
I've had to get rid of the fish tank.  The floppy little bastards keep blowing holes in the walls with it.
I've heard this line listening to various sports radio shows, but it definitely holds true when perusing news about politics.  "Journalism 101: When you're reading or hearing something, you have to ask, why are you lying to me?"  #Gab #MAGA
I've long said there's a 50/50 chance that Hilldawg drops out for health reasons and Biden takes her spot.  Even this late, I think its still a possibility.  #HillaryHealth
I've looked at IF.  It actually makes a lot of sense.  But I can't get past not eating in the morning.  I don't get hungry, I get nauseous to the point of pain.  Hahaha...  The idea, I think, is to force your body to burn it's own fat stores.
I've never gotten a job offer on the same day as the interview. #wewlad so excited my fellow gabbers #gab #gabfam
I've never seen anything like that, holy shit #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
I've noticed a few people are verified. Is it easier to get verified on #gab or twitter? I was once verified on Pinterest...until they redid how they verify and I lost it. I actually don't understand why they did that but I still like Pinterest's site anyway but still can't believe it a year later
I've only had to spend two days going back and forth to the hospital because of my husband's surgery and I'm already pooped. I have nothing but the greatest admiration for caretakers of people with chronic conditions. God bless them!

I've started attending a self-help group for sex addicts. I haven't got an addiction. It's just a great way of meeting sluts.
I've still yet to meet anyone who supports or see any Liazadry support by way of yard signs of car stickers. But I see Trump stickers, signs and hear verbal support on a daily basis. In Southern California no less.   #DonaldIsLoved
I've wanted to be able to Speak Freely for a long time, I'm only half myself on twitter.  There's so much more to know about me.  Taking a plunge here, for the 1st public time ever, I'm going to introduce another part of me.  I'm bisexual.  There, I said it. 
I've watched many Trump rallies and all his policy speeches solo, in threads, and with friends. First time with the #GabFam . Looking forward to it.

Ibushi is mental. The moves he has agreed to take coming off a neck surgery just astounds me. He is the absolute opposite of a #Jobber  #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE

If Hillary Clinton is elected, I'm predicting there will be a Second Civil War. This time about Liberty and Freedom... #CivilWar #HillaryClinton #Tyranny #Freedom #Liberty   *I am not promoting violence, I am making a prediction of what may occur (highly unlikely)*
If Hillary wasn't trained on classification, or no records show it, the State Department must admit to violating national security protocols.    If Hillary was trained on classification, and the records show it, then we have more evidence of her willful negligence. http://bit.ly/2cgAZz2
If Hillary wins (shudder), will she still be dealing with "the mess that Bush left behind"?

If I ever give an acceptance speech, I'm going to thank my student loans just so I can say "I don't think I can ever repay you."  No, seriously, they won't let me pay them off early 😡
If I had a vagina it would be so wet right now, but I don't.     However, I have an anus. And that's wet for some reason.

In all this there is some who hate and will try to ruin something they can not control. They will "shit post" and the post will be hateful. They will spam users with the @ and pictures that user would never post. They will cry foul and freedom of speech if someone saids something about it. 1/2
In Europe, lots of people are afraid to speak their mind about immigration problems... it's kinda sad. 
In France, the police are taking action against people caught wearing a burka. So far they've arrested 4 Muslims and 7 letterboxes 
In interesting news, a lot of YouTubers are getting their videos flagged and demonetized for having controversial topics. This is a very bad omen, considering the kind of Orwellian groupthink Twitter and Facebook are trying to push.   Philip DeFranco's video on it:  https://youtu.be/Gbph5or0NuM

It appears all my posts are actually being downvoted by @pikari even though it says they are being liked
It appears that the most efficient way to collect downvotes is to propose new #Gab features. For example, I strongly suggest we add a Flirt-O-Meter to each post to detect sexually charged language and add it to a running Total Slut Score at the top of our profiles. IT'S PERFECT!
It feels like everyday is worse than the last. This latest YouTube news just breaks my heart even more. Have the regressives already won?

My wife made me a pizza-cake for my birthday one year. She said it was a pain in the ass to make so she won't do it again.  I dream about that pizza-cake. Naughty dreams that aren't at all like a McChicken. Get your head out of the gutter!

Not sure if #Trump going soft on immigration the past 2 weeks was him listening to consultants or playing 4D chess with the press. End result is Trump built up so much anticipation for his immigration speech; everyone is watching.

NUMBER 2!  WE ARE GOING TO END CATCH AND RELEASE.  Anyone crosses, you are detained and removed and brought back to the country in which they came. Not just dropping off across, we will bring them great distances.
NUMBER 3!  ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS!  ZERO, ZERO, ZERO! #MAGA
Numer One! Are you ready? We will BUILD A WALL all the way across our Southern Border.  #TrumpLive #BuildtheWall  Man, his speech made Ben Shapiro roll in his baby cuck crib.  But it fired me up, that's for sure.

Occasionally you just have to tell @me hi, so the people that actually do talk to themselves don't look left out. ;) #Gab is a place you can talk to @pizza.

Oh hell yeah
Oh I see #TrumpLive tag. Nevermind.

Oh, and this first 'debate'?  Two candidates go on stage ONE AFTER THE OTHER, separately.  That's not a debate, that's two live interviews by Matt Lauer.  Proves the leading two are gutless fucking cowards incapable of defending their beliefs.  #LETGARYDEBATE
Ohh gabtags. Like it. 
ok
Ok #BritFam I'm no #Socialist but the flack Jeremy Corbyn is getting from the Conservatives, Labor and the MSM has a lot of parallels to the united front #Trump is fighting against in the US.   If he manages to keep control of Labor I'll be tempted to vote for him just to piss off the establishment.
Ok #GabFam. I'm newb. Is there a 'how to' guide/section anywhere? Also what's best way to discover content (I only see "Popular", Trending Hashtags and my Followers links) - is there a 'most recent postings' link I'm missing?
Ok #GabFam....headed to kitchen to cook dinner. Do all the upvotes and things so the kids hear the ribbits and think we're having frog...
ok but seriously you know whats fucked up? the electoral fuckety-fucking college!

Ok, so Twitter needs no help to shoot itself in the foot. And hopefully Gab (or any other alternative) will gather enough steam to lift off and be a serious competitor.   But what about Facebook and Youtube? Like damn, who can even imagine taking those out?
Ok.... I could pretty much play the #BattleField1 into music ... Where is the fiddle....

Okay what's happening for the @GabQueers
Okay, #GIFARMY you crazy bastards. 
Okay, if I miss anyone's posts to me I apologise. I'm getting hammered by someone called @pikari downvoting all my posts but appearing to make it look like they are upvoting them, my notifications are ridiculous right now so there's no chance of me finding anything in them.
Okay, if I missed saying "Hi" to you over the last hour, I'm sorry, I had a little distraction that seems to be just about over now. So Hi!
Okay, if you're following pikari you should unfollow and mute them, otherwise it could happen to you.
Okies, well, it's getting late so I'm gonna crash folks.  Hope everyone has a great evening.  Laters, #GabFam

One day, a man came home and was greeted by his wife dressed in a very sexy nightie. "Tie me up," she purred, "And you can do anything you want." So he tied her up and went golfing.
One last note:  Right Side Broadcasting Youtube feed of #TrumpLive actually shows the crowds.    To me, that's honest coverage.

Seriously, out of 318.9 MILLION people in the U.S., we had to choose THESE two? WHAT THE FUCKETY-FUCK IS WRONG WITH US?!
Seriously, shouldn't we provide free food, healthcare, and education to people who have to swim across a river to get here? So what if they're here illegally? Open borders, people! #HillarySays

Shut up 
SICK #StopHillary https://sli.mg/1gQVLF
Sick of working for some else? Fed up of taking instructions from idiots?  Want to forge your own destiny?  Yeah me too, any ideas how? 
Since Donald Trump personally funded many of the politicians whose policies he now criticizes, isn't he partially to blame? #TrumpAZ
Since we can't block I will mute any one that post racy & indescent pictures. It is so sad for a woman to think that she has to be half naked on a social site to get noticed. if anyone doing this doesn't like my words then mute me because you can bet that I have muted you. Beauty not Nuddie

SJW BERATES LYFT DRIVER: http://youtu.be/6LdmBqJLYcU  Infuriating. 
SJW gets "offended" by a Hawaiinan figure and loses it: https://youtu.be/MMT3vuSQk3g
SJW's are the shock troops in the Grand Convergence of every institution to Post-Modern Intersectional Dildoism. The only correct response is Esoteric Spencerism Frog Squads.  #RealTalk #DeepThoughts
SJWs need to learn some old primary school sayings. Things like "Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me."

Smells Like Goats Spirit #MakeASongIslamic
so #how do I add pictures to my messages, or isn't that implemented yet?
So @youtube is heading down the same shit road as @twitter and @facebook smh http://www.pcinvasion.com/youtube-sparks-confusion-not-advertiser-friendly-flags
So about 50,000 tuned into Donald Trumps live stream of his speech last night absolutely amazing #MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
So approx. how many members are signed up for gab now?  #Gab #GabFam
So as my pimp haram grows, here's another "shawty" everyone should follow.  @itsonlywords
So at least one will know advertisers that approve of YouTube's new policies by advertising on #YouTube and thus which products to avoid.
so check out this guys banner - > @TheSibylSpeaks   #Trump #MAGA
So even if he doesn`t intend a condescending attitude towards B and denies being patronizing, he still benefits from their power dynamics of dominance/oppression. In fact,the more he denies the denegration and oppression of B, the more he partakes in it & enforces the exploitation of their relation.
So far i like Gab, but i think some overlay changes are needed, its hard to read the layout since it uses identical white almost everywhere
so far loving the lack of anime "boobs" on this site 
So far Trump has only said bad stuff about Hillary and Obama. No policy stuff yet. 
So far we've got more explanations on Pokémon Sun/Moon, Mario Maker 3DS, a new Mario Party, and an update on Animal Crossing New Leaf. #NintendoDirect 
So far, I've had to reset my password 4 or 5 times this morning.  I keep getting redirected to a login page, and then told "your credentials do not match our records".  Anyone else having this problem?
So far, this has actually been a quite usable beta :) I'm not techy but I do occasionally help test and review betas, ARCs, and  WIPs. I'm looking forward to a simple way to post pics. And the people are great :) #GabFam #support 
So first Twitter and now YouTube?! What the hell is going on with censorship?!   I thought the first amendment gave us the right to #SpeakFreely, but I guess I was wrong, huh?
So for a snarky rebuttal to the "goberment ain't trying to take your free speech away" argument, state as a matter of simple fact:  "Oh, so you are suggesting that social justice warriors are not real people?"  Because #WeThePeople ARE the government.  #SpeakFreely
So for some reason Matt Lauer (??) will be moderating the first presidential 'forum' (not a debate!) on national security on September 7th in NYC. The audience will be service members. Since this is a 'forum', how much do you want to bet Hillary will get to sit on a couch?  http://nbcnews.to/2chYjwi
So glad myiq is back to posting! https://crayfisher.wordpress.com/2016/09/01/roshomon-rorschach
So happy Picross 3D 2 has been released in the West finally. Picross 3D is the best puzzle game ever made, hoping the sequel offers just as much or even improves on what was there before. ;w;
So how come a member of the Clinton Global Initiative gets selected moderator of the presidential debate?
so how does this thing work? let's do some test-shitposting......can I add images to this?
So how many invites will be in spam filters now?
So I got a NOC notification that didn't specify which client it was for, and two of the three are no longer clients. out of curiosity I remoted into one, and the new IT support, 10 months later, never changed the admin password. #hahaha
So I see we do have a #Shitposter on here that is trying really hard to rattle the feathers of our happy #GabFam! NOT gonna happen dipshit! Hahaha😉
So I take it there is no Markdown support, not even a limited set?  #SchoolOfGab
So I was scoping out this #TrumpLive Speech and I have to say I'm pretty surprised. I thought ADOLF FUCKING HITLER was dead during WW2!!! https://i.sli.mg/5AEtRx.png Dongoloid TrumpTits doesn't seem to be hiding it anymore. #OhCarl #AmazingSpeech
So I was thinking to myself, "self, how do I 'like' a gab post?" when I just noticed the reddit up & down style votes.  Time for moar coffee 
So I'm listening to "Roll The Bones" by Rush and can't for the life of me understand why they took a mediocre song and made it simply #awful with that #rap section. Then I thought, well at least it's not this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g  #SoSorry
So I've been blocked by 3 people on twatter, and been RTed by a SJW history professor. Hows your day going #GabFam?  
So is it possible to post images?
So it is 69 days until the election.  Trump is on the campaign trail. #WheresHillary?  Practicing the position with Huma.
So it's seems I'm 19 away from #200Followers, all the more reason for me to keep working on #MyArt. #GabFam #Gab #OnTrack #ToTheTop
So just a heads up...  On Friday, I'll be playing #PathofExile which their new expansion is dropping, so I might not be as active for a few days.  Needs to farm new gear on the new server.
So kids, is there #doom in the air today? Pretty-much like any day that ends in the letter #y? On the upside, my FitBit awarded me a "You've lost your 30th pound!" badge today, so there's that.
So many leftist narratives were destroyed in the past 24 hours, weeeeeew lad. #TrumpLive #MAGA
So much energy at this Trump speech, bring some of it down under! #Trump #MAGA
So much for trying to help people.
So much stress at work. Alot if it was relieved, though I called a competitor to my company asked if he was hiring and could I send in my resume.  He said he knew who I was and what I was about and just come meet him for lunch no resume needed.   #feelsgood 
So my dating pool just shrank by one because a girl watched me eat tuna salad with a flash card.
So now everybody's shouting VOTE TRUMP! etc.  #GabLive #Trump
So now that Mexico has officially refused to pay for this giant wall, who's paying for it? #TrumpAZ   Or will there be a wall at all?
So now the United States anthem is racist? I....I literally don't know what to say back to these SJW... I'm speechless 😶
so people can't openly talk about the society's issues because it's inaceptable. Nice YouTube #YouTubeIsOverParty https://t.co/vOvVrQaoDC
So some D.C. politicos are calling for an investigation of possible ties between Trump, the Russians, and the leaks. Yet those same people DON'T CARE ABOUT the *CONTENT* of those emails. #corruption
So the 1st amendment only pertains to the government, so I have learned. That doesn't mean we should be censored on social media. Facebook, Twitter, it should all be fair and balanced towards its users, not just a few... 
So the new Youtube monetization rules means that almost no video game footage can be monetized because "violence" right? Including trailers and... advertisements.
So tired...shouldn't sleep yet...but probably will, and then my sleep schedule will be messed up. :( 
So with YouTube going the way of Twitter and Facebook with its Liberal censorship, how long until Vimeo becomes the new popular video site?
So work hired this /v/irgin. All he did was bitch about how the job was too easy and snark at anyone except this one guy with a few anime magnets at his desk. We were talking about the vidya we were playing and he said it all sucked and he just played Dark Souls.  They fired his sperg ass.
So you can`t win, and if you deny looking down on your conversation partner, you still unknowingly denegrate him, demean his habitus, cultural and linguistic backround... denial makes you an even bigger exploitator and reinforces your "privilege'. ...So THAT`s what they smoke in SocJus courses, huh?
So you think you're safe up there mate. https://t.co/9OLxQYuuY7
So, <gab.ai> trying to compete with Twitter?  I'm interested in seeing how it turns out. 
So, are we all guilty because we paid for the e-mail server HRC broke the law with?  http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/bill-clinton-used-tax-dollars-to-subsidize-foundation-private-email-support-teneo-227613?utm_source=jolt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Jolt09012016&utm_term=Jolt
So, how was #TrimpLive ? Just got back in for the night... #GabFam #Gab #SpeakFreely
So, is there an app for this puppy yet or what?
So, it's Tweddit?
So, on the topic of speech and language within the context of colonial and post-colonial societies, when we have a speaker A (colonizer) and speaker B (colonized), he posits that even if A tries putting himself out as equal to B and speaks in B`s language, it`s still in a way exploitative. How so?>>
So, so much shitposting and i haven't seen porn yet. I am impressed. Well done #Gab community, well done indeed! 
So, um... what are we doing about THIS:  https://youtu.be/iqAJGXI5l88
So, what's REALLY happening in the world?? 
So, where's the 72 virgins at?
So, who is drunk right now? Need some pissy messages to wake me up😉
So... ummm... When I view the above on my desktop, I see squares. When I view it on my Android tablet I see chickens. Browser is Chrome on Ubuntu. Anyone who sees this have the link to the buglist so I can see if this is reported already? Tho I bet it is...

Something that I've noticed. I always feel terrible if I use the bus and don't walk to campus. I feel even worse if I eat something sugary like cake or whatever. Weird. 
Sometimes I forget my own username @Butt @Butt @Butt
Sometimes you can have all the right ideas but with the wrong people in power and a brainwashed population, you and everybody else will be pushed around. We need advocates otherwise like it or not we will be collectivists soon enough.

Synthetic marijuana is wreaking havoc in many places as so many do not need jobs and the jobs do not exist due to the liberal plantation philosophy implemented by Obama, Hillary, etal.  I believe jobs are the solution to many of our pervasive societal problems.  https://i.sli.mg/v2NISd.jpg

That German from the ropes was the most brutal German I've ever seen. Hitler included.   #CWC #ProWrestling #WWE
that in simplicity is correct: I would further delve into the fact they became %1 by carving the margins from wages & large profit margins. They will always have the choice of leaving their assets behind. <-- I don't fully agree with this, but I haven't reconciled it.
That last post reads so bad!    Honest, I'm not like that!

The Best part about Gab is that there are currently no Nerofags on it.
The biggest problem with western society today is its impossible to have a sensible discussion with the anyone about political Islam.  If we find a way to seperate Islam the religion from Islam the political idealology in the minds of the Left & the Muslims it may be possible for them to intergrate.
The Blacks Lives Matter organization is a hate group. The fact that our beloved okie doke president invited them to the White House is awful and desperate. #AllLivesMatter

The Cinemark lawsuit issue is a non-starter.  All plaintiffs were told it was going to fail by the judge, because of the state suit.  All but one accepted a settlement TO THEM. All but four bailed. Four greedy idiots stayed and now they have to pay court costs.  It's really, really simple.
The civil rights hero's I grew up with are supporting Trump,while rap & hip hop artists support Hillary,Let that sink in while I go fix a snack.

The conductor of my wife's lie detector test revealed that my wife had been unfaithful. "How reliable are these results?" I asked him. "Very," he replied. "She sucked me off in the car park earlier."

The fed is part a globalist plan to monopolize a one-world currency. To do this, they "level the playing field" through monetary policy-- by weakening our currency in order to strengthen others.  This is being done in full lock-step with fiscal policy measures to export jobs overseas.

The great thing with the New Right (Alt-Right, NRx) is not that is idolizes right-wing ideals (whatever that means) but that it finally formulates a critique of the Right from the Right itself. This allows for the Right to become intellectually self-sufficient. This is both a good and a bad thing.
THE GREAT WALL OF TRUMP!!!! MAKE IT HAPPEN!!! BUILD THE F--KING WALL!!!! #TrumpinPheonix #MAGA
The hateful Trump haters have hated their own candidate and hate themselves for it. So they lash out At the alt right. Scapegoat them. We get called hateful by bitter resentful authoritarians. We get bullied ( and media encourages ) by those who preach bout ending bullying. Hypocrisy.

The Media all of a sudden is concerned about a 12 Billion dollar taxpayer expenditure - this is the point they're missing. You think we would even give a shit if America had to pay for the wall, when Obama has spent 10 Trillion fucking dollars over the last 8 years? The wall's cost is nothing #MAGA
The media doesn't know wtf rn
The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one; don't let it happen it depends on you

The Neverending Story and I share a birthday. I guess I know what I'm watching today.
The new demonitization practices from YouTube are stupid. YouTube already operates at a loss. Less ads = less ad revenue and YouTubers who get flagged will stop uploading altogether because of the hassle so even "approved" content won't exist for ad placement.

The only thing that was missing from Trump's huuuge & epic speech in Mexico was an Old Glory Flag behind him on-stage !  #Trump #TrupLive #MAGA #Gab

The reason why Trump's Wall is such a brilliant idea is simple: it's both a powerful measure and a symbol of its own. A wall creates a separation, it excludes, and thus defines what is inside. A nation only exists because not everybody is part of it. Belonging is a rival good.
The reason why users of 4chan's /lit/erature board hate self publishing is because to become a successful self published author, one must also become famous on the internet, something which is impossible to do while anonymous.
The Regressive Leftists and the Global Corportate Establishment are moving to defraud every Trump voter   The leftists fail to see the hypocrisy of being hateful and calling others hateful because although its truthful - it is inconvenient.
The Right Side Broadcasting Youtube livestream reach 50,000 followers during the #TrumpLive speech tonight.  That's literally 10 times the number of viewers I've every seen on any Hillary livestream speech.  I'm speechless.

There are a LOT of fanboys on #Gab  #whoknew?
There are schools in AZ with gender-soecific curriculums:  Women get entrepreneur and business classes.   Men get classes related to the plight of women (wage inequality, social issues, oppression, etc.)  They're training beta males. Never would I send my children there. I'm literally stunned. 
There goes another one of my grievances towards Trump.

This obviously goes against the very idea of a "proposition nation", considering the characteristic of Rational discourse is that it is universal and potentially entails all the peoples of the world. Trump says instead that America is an exclusive club, with a responsibility toward its members.

To be skeptical of #climatechange and who causes it is actually to accept science. To say that "if you deny climate change/man-made climate change then you deny science" is actually to deny science. Also, 97% of all scientists don't belive climate change. ;) #TheMoreYouKnow

Trump & Clinton in a statistical tie for unfavorable view among registered voters https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/a-record-number-of-americans-now-dislike-hillary-clinton/ 
Trump - "This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws. This is it. Our last time." November 8th is gonna be a date where we can change things and secure our Nation.  You goys better vote Trump #TrumpLive
Trump - "Those here illegally have one route and one route only, to return home and try again legally" NO AMNESTY #TrumpLive 
Trump can't be stumped. Build that wall #MAGA

Trump Gets Last Laugh With Trip To Mexico & Immigration Speech http://regated.com/2016/09/trump-gets-last-laugh-trip-mexico-immigration-speech/
Trump goes to Mexico and show people how to get things done like an adult. Opinions can change and was mentioned in the speech.

Trump had him a drop mic moment today. That's our President. 
Trump has had more press conferences in Mexico than Hillary has had in the USA.  #Trump #NeverHillary
Trump has really shown me something the past couple of months...I think he's gaining traction and that Mexico trip/Arizona speech was just what the doctor ordered. 
Trump is 70 and his schedule is fatiguing me. In the last 24 hours: Meeting in Mexico yesterday afternoon, major immigration speech in Phoenix last night, Cincinnati this morning and speaking in  Wilmington, OH right now.  #NoBrakes
Trump is incredibly pro active at the moment.  +Mexico  +Huge rallies  +Stirring speeches.   Hillary is on her heels playing defense. All she has done lately is offer condescending rebuttals to everything Trump is saying.   #TheFireRises

Trump killed it last night.  I'm ready for some Debate action.  I think I may be a bit hopeful to expect any level of fairness from moderators. 
Trump leading in the polls nationally today. Hillary absolutely in shock.   There is an awakening folks!

Trump locked up the Election tonite   #MAGA
Trump may or may not win the election. (Shocking I know)  But more importantly if he wins or not is will the political pressure cooker ease? The hatred most Americans have of politicians isn't going away and likely American politics will get more extreme if the pressure builds. Trump might be hope.

Well guys, YouTube is falling down into the land of over censoring everything. You guys at #gab better get to work on making a new youtube now XD
Well I guess that speech pretty well btfo the medias narrative as of late that the Donald was softening his position on immigration. #TrumpLive
Well it could be worse http://sli.mg/J6oAsS
Well no,she just staggers up,says some stupid shit,& lays back down.
Well that rumor is put to rest.  http://i.imgur.com/fdf0yyg.jpg
Well that was a nice cruise. Hey, my idiot rival was there too, so I guess his dad cares about him too. Anyway, I'm lost in a land of wheat fields. I did get Phil the Mareep though. #PokemonUranium #Gaming #PC https://i.sli.mg/6QqUIw.png
Well this looks about as useful as I thought it'd be.  Maybe it'll grow. Best of luck gab. And with the genocide.   
Well YouTube continues to be bullshit n
Well, I think I'll lower the #BritFam flag for another day.   G'night #Gab wherever you are.
Well, I'm off here for the evening. Goodnight everyone. #Gab 
Well, it's bed time for me, @6uitarded I'll get you your black white character in the am. As for the rest of the #GabFam, continue to feed my ego in my quest for #200Followers! #Sleeptight #Gab
Well, no response to my #Cigar inquiry, so how about any #NYGiants fans?
Well, of you don't hear it again for another 15 days, THANKS FOR DOING THIS. 
Well, the days are long and the nights short when you go to bed at @ 5 & up @ 10. So I think I'll sign off for now and see my #GabFam again this evening. G'night #Ribbits and #Ribbettes (See what I did there?). Sleep calleth, beckoneth, requires of me to answer.  #GabOnSweetPrince!
Well. First Impressions of #Gab ? It doesn't freeze my browser every time I try to retrieve my feed like Twitter, so that's a start.
Welp, see ya, jerks.   #MAGA  http://www.worldpoliticus.com/muslims-threaten-donald-trump-will-president-will-leave-us-video/
were almost there, just without the lashies.
Wet like morning dew before you plow my field  because I'm a pussy  #haiku
WEW 1111 KEKS  Praise #KEK  #Tendies all around
WEW Lads! I might break 300 tonight! It's gunna be a good night!  #Trump #MAGA https://media3.giphy.com/media/HhNP8q6pFYD9C/giphy.gif #GIFWAR #FreedomBoner 
Wew! We're back! #BritFam
What a total disaster. I feel a little bad for a lot of the bullying of Mollygos that went on, but apart from that, all parties involved can get fucked. Goons: not once
What about an email client and a smartphone OS?
What am I missing #GABFam on Trumps speech? #MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
What an exciting time to be alive!  Donald Trump will be our next President and @a Andrew Torba is giving us our free speech!!!  It's Revolution Time!  #TrumpLive #MAGA #Trump
What Bernie, leftists, and all of these "free college" folks don't tell you is that there IS infact a college in the US that doesn't charge any tuition at all!   https://www.cofo.edu/
What did the leper say to the prostitute?  Keep the tip.
what do the little points on the Gab profile mean
What do you all here on #GAB think about this?  I'm quite torn on having the ability to block people from seeing my content.  On the one hand, it makes sense.  However, in practice it seems to get used to let you speak behind someone's back (on Twitter), as they cannot read your replies if blocked.
What do you call a 25 stone woman in a burka? A Must Slim.
What do you call a dead prostitute?  Free.
What do you call a Muslim who owns 6 goats? A pimp. #SaySomethingOffensive  (Don't worry, I'll be equally horrible to Christians, Jews and Atheists. Plenty of offense to come.)
What do you do? 
What do you get when you fuck too many fish?  MermAids. 
What do you guys think of my dog?
What do you guys think? Was #NoMansSky a piece of crap, a fraud, both or neither? #Gaming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYNriatnYkE
What do you think about this website http://peek.rocks
What do you think of when you read the description " Asian Man"http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2016/09/the-mysterious-case-of-the-asian-man-and-the-never-seen-arab-man/
What does #gab think of the concept of #WhitePrivilege? We went over the civil war today and somehow ended up on the topic of Black Lives matter and white privilege. Apparently thinking all lives matter is a joke and is like comparing a house on fire to one that isn't. #SpeakFreely 
What does it mean when I hit 'Send' and I get a notice "Error Occurred"?
What guns am I packing for the range this long weekend? Pistols, Rifles, hmmmm its always a tough choice.
What happened #Gab #GabFam ? Were we invaded?  http://m.imgur.com/gallery/iVHfwLc
What happened last night?  Going back to bed  OG
what happens when I flag a post?

What I find even more disgusting about the inhumane floggings enforced by Saudi Arabia, is that they are heading the UN's Human Rights Council. Fucking hypocrites. The UN is a failed organisation that needs to be disbanded.
What is #Trump doing when I have people like Piers Morgan and #PewDiePie on my political side. Two people I absolutely cannot stand. I am so confused. I don't know whats up or down anymore! #TrumpLive #MAGA
What is genocide directed against a species of animal called? Not joking. #Gab
What is that I here? Could it be...  Freedom Pride America First  ...or maybe it's just the wall getting 10FT HIGHER!!!  #Trump #TrumpLive #GabLive
What is the YouTube alternative? Opportunity is knocking & someone needs to open the flipping door! If I had any clue how to start a website like that I'd be all over it. If anyone is on this I can make myslef helpful... #GabFam #Gab #SpeakFreely #YouTubeAlternative 
What is this new '!' button I'm seeing? 
What is this the 16th day of #Gab? Where it's at is nothing short of remarkable. When the app finally comes out it's going to be even better, I'm sure. Respect to all who built, and are building, this platform.
What is wrong with youtube, it almost brings my pc to a standstill when I open it.
What kind of fish do gay pirates prefer?  Arrrrrrrr sole.

What the fuck? There was a greatest hits album called The Essential Korn (an oxymoron) released five years ago?   Fuck my ass. I'm older than the pharaohs.  I'm officially going to bed on that note. Good night #GabFam
What the heck is going on with YouTube?
What the hell does #TrumpLive mean? He just created a new offspring or what? 
What the hell happened during Trump live, Did you get engaged? @rose
What this speech feels like   https://i.sli.mg/6kVaH4.png  #Comfy  #TrumpLive
What we are fighting for; who we are fighting for:   Trump joined by Angel Moms.  #GabLive  #TrumpLive  #MAGA
What will I tell the little pepe's when they ask, "Daddy, what's a error 500 and why are you sad?"
What would your curriculum look like #edchat
What's different about the right? We don't just watch what some pundit has to say about Trump or Hillary. We don't just listen to what some "reporter" wants us to think. We watch the opposition. We listen. We think for ourselves. We observe and we make up our own minds. #thinkfreely #speakfreely
What's going on with YouTube? #GabFam #YouTube
What's good you meme loving fucks 
What's the #GabFam up to tonight?
What's the best thing about #Trump?
What's the difference between a suicide vest and a #feminist?  A suicide vest does something when it's #triggered.

What's the proper way to spend crowdfunded money as a gamedev?  ☐ Hire more talent ☐ Give your employees a raise ☐ Invest in good equipment ☐ Budget for a long development cycle ☐ Marketing ☑ Buying a miniature panther for the office  http://puu.sh/qVS7j/69ff951ccb.png
What's up #gabfam? Great speech from #daddy last night. Every speech and rally is better and better. He is out doing #Presidential things, while #crookedkilLIARyrottenklanton is sleeping! 
What's up with the #RIPBantu @EvanSus96
What's wrong with foreign donations? I mean Saudi Arabia has oil! They got money, baby, and I have a Foundation to funnel money through! #HillarySays
What's wrong with releasing relatively nonviolent criminals into society? I mean, they just need love, hugs, and a second chance! #HillarySays
What? No pics?
WHAT?!?!? 4000 FROG POINTS? YEAH!
Whats the deal with trump? Him building a wall isn't going to solve any problems. The money used to fund that wall will run the US more in debt then it already was. Trump is really using the president card to make his family richer.
WHATS UP BOI @oly
Whelp... I've been vindicated. Not only was I right that the media was making up the "TRUMP WAS MOCKING THE DISABLED REPORTER" I was right that he mocks others exactly like he did Serge Kovaleski: https://youtu.be/M4604reEqk0  And Serge Kovaleski doesn't even move that way either.
When #WeThePeople lobby the government for the right to not be offended, it's government infringing upon the freedom of speech.  I have a right to speak my mind without being murdered. I have a right to speak my mind without losing my kids. I have a right to speak my mind without losing my job.  
When anyone advocates completely open borders, I invite them to leave their house and car unlocked.
When Biden went to Serbia he was greeted by an army of Trump supporters. More than any rally Hillary's held in America 😂 #MAGA   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b860pqwOIos
When crowd chants #LockHerUp, Rudy replies "Let's beat her!"  THAT MIGHT BE MESSY!  #GabLive #Trump
When debating an SJW/liberal, DO NOT fall for their empty character attacks or respond with your own. Own their asses with the strength of your logic and facts. Your goal should be to put them in a dunce cap and keep them there until they cry uncle.

When eating a salad, put a small amount of dressing on the top, cover your bowl with a plate, and shake it around. It takes less than the recommended serving of 2 tablespoons to cover a large salad. #NutritionTips

When Hillary gets up from her coma to turn on the news and finds out Trump had a conference with the Mexican president, had a high energy rally in Phoenix, and is having another one in Ohio. https://i.sli.mg/ZV1cxn.gif #NoBrakes #HillarysHealth
When I drink Vietnamese coffee, am I guilty of cultural appropriation? Or are the Vietnamese guilty of cultural appropriation? Am I guilty of appropriating their appropriated culture? Help.
When I eat collard greens or Spinach, I put a small amount of mango salsa on it to stomach large amounts. Only adds about 25 calories when done right. #NutritionTips

When I grow up I want to be a border patroller. I'd love to stand on that great wall and serve justice to those who deserve it!
When I lift weights in the gym I imagine that I am one of the Riders of Rohan preparing myself for battle against the armies of Mordor. Except Mordor are SJWs and progressive lefties...And Rohan is the last bastion of conservatism. 
When I say "voluntary state controlled media":  An involuntary one would be like the Soviet Union, the gov't explicitly mandates what can/can't be reported.  Whereas if it's voluntary, the media is opting-in aligning their reporting with the best interest of those in power. End result is the same.
When I see people getting down on Millennials I think about just who makes up most of our military, police, and first responders now. The kids are alright.
When i started working in tech, same thing. Set your own damn printers up, fuckbois. 
When I was younger, I always felt like I was a man trapped in a woman's body.  Then I was born.

When you call gamers a bunch of entitled assholes because they want to get a refund for a game they legally paid for, how does that NOT encourage piracy?  If somebody told me "FUCK YOU" for not liking what I paid for, I'd never pay for that shit again.  #GamerGate #NoMansSky

with the recent youtube guideline i think it's time for an alternative youtube. what do you guys think  
With this youtube news, I really do believe that Gab has to be the future of social networks. Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube all have a clearly anti-free-speech agenda. 
With YouTube's new T&C they are going to hemorrhage users.   It makes me wonder the direction that Google themselves are going. Is my android phone going to start blurring out words that may scare me?

Yesterday in Trump's speech he said "and we will send them back immediately, if it even comes to that" what does that mean? That legit sounds kinda troubling.

Yo, what's this talk of #TheBand I'm seeing
Yo, where are the titty accounts on this bitch? 
you are going to need a lot of storage space <3
You are my source for dank gifs @ace
You can create your own reality and it can really suck if your a Prog. #ImWithHillary  https://i.sli.mg/4tPN0r.jpg
You can tell that @realDonaldTrump is kicking ass... the Dems are getting ever more shrill. #TrumpEnMexico 
You can`t post images on Gab yet? I have seen people do it, however can`t find an icon for it in the "share" field.
You did good, my son. Don't become a #ClintonBodyCount statistic while you're on the inside! #MAGA   http://news.sky.com/story/guccifer-hacker-marcel-lazar-who-exposed-clintons-private-email-account-is-jailed-10561737
You forgot: "Stupid racist!!!"

You got your tires slashed for Trump?   #PepeWouldBeProud
You guys need a clever music video?  Yes, yes you do.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHYWD29ZNY 
You had me at "I'm a Star Wars fan"
You had me at goofball ;)
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
You heard it here first (I think): #Trump's Sec of Labor? Mike Rowe. (A dozen speeches on vocational training, the dignity of manual labor, then... he disbands the Dept of Labor and goes home to S.F.)
You know how this is going to be spun right? "Gee Golly, i thought his convention speech was dark, but this is the darkest thing I've ever seen or heard of ever in the world before" #TrumpLive
you know it
You know what really bugs me about Hillary's spaz with the reporters, is her attempt to distract them from pursuing questions by saying immediately, 'You really should try this Chai Tea".  I mean who gives a fuck about the tea, woman.  Fooling no one.  #SpeakFreely
You know what, I'm really considering becoming a Politican and eventually run for Prime Minister of Canada. 
You said hello to @Cernovich yet? What a lad! Big balls.
You see Bernie? THIS is how you not only make a movement, but actually SUSTAIN a movement! #TrumpLive #MAGA
You see, I can go on like this all night. If it saves friends from having to deal with the hassle, I'm happy to oblige
You two inspired me. 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about https://i.sli.mg/OO8itU.jpg
you wanna hear a good joke?  NOBODY SPEAK, NOBODY GET CHOKED https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUC2EQvdzmY
You will all end up hating me on Saturdays, but goddamnit, it's almost time!  https://i.sli.mg/sp3hUV.jpg  #CFB
You won't see me without my ninja suit on! #MakeASongIslamic

YouTube      [*]    R.I.P
Youtube are also removing advertising from any videos that contain swearing or things they don't like as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCRJvXMixZY
YouTube basically set another tier of possible punishment on creators who can be just hurt starting from losing time and money because of the removal of features through the Community Guideline Strikes, or lose time and money by demonetisation, which is permanent. #GabFam #YouTube
YouTube changes are just retarded. Nice.
YouTube Cracks Down On Controversial Creators - aka YouTube wants to become subtanceless family friendly-vlog Tube. https://youtu.be/RW-Dmd4fzZE
YouTube has updated its Terms and Conditions regarding video monetisation. Your video will no longer be monetized if it includes "controversial or sensitive subjects and events...even if graphic imagery is not shown!". Pretty vague. Not open for politically motivated abuse at all.
Youtube is now jumping into censoring people... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbph5or0NuM #Speakfreely
Youtube is stripping ad money from youtubers if they swear too much and vids aren't ad friendly #Censorship #Gabfam #Maga #Twitter #Youtube #Facebook #Marketing #Advertising https://facebook.com/CwbinTnMichaelWinton/photos/a.276997872503798.1073741828.276743532529232/550200211850228/?type=3
YouTube just became the Cartoon Network & lots of Kitten videos..smh Thanks SJW's for our loss of Free Speech! grrrrrrrr  They take monetization away from political content, but #CtrlLEFT vids are fine! UGH  We DO need global warming to melt all the little sensitive SNOWFLAKES!!!  #MAGA #GabFam
YouTube made Drudge. We need #GabTube @a
Youtube openly cutting funding from classical liberals not regressive weirdos. People i tell keep assuming the system must be right or need explanations. Ive never known cognitive dissonance like it.
YouTube will be next to need newer, freer alternative. Censorship = Sad.
YouTube's new ad revenue policy now removes and prevents monetization on videos that contain anti-SJW content, among other things.  http://www.oneangrygamer.net/2016/08/youtube-blocks-ad-revenue-on-anti-sjw-content/10819/
