And armoured unit was activated, ammunition drawn, weapons loaded and readied at the causeway. If there was any suggestion that an attack was likely then the unit would have raced across the causeway and established some form of holding position.

98.4% of cases have minor or zero symptoms. This means nearly all who catch covid recover and keep living, indeed they gain natural immunity which is being proven to have much greater prophylactic value than any vaccine in the face of future contagion. There is no value given for the vaxxed vs unvaxxed ratios of asymptomatic covid at Ministry of Health. If you find it, please share. The good news is that nearly all who get covid recover, it would be helpful to know what ratio of vaxxed to unvaxxed is in that 98% (does it proportionately represent the the ratio of total vaxxed population? ). Of the remaining 1.6% infirmity is 50/50 Vaccinated vs unvaxxed, thus the argument that only unvaxxed are a burden on the healthcare system is an exaggeration,though the case that unvaxxed are over represented and overly burdensome in intensive care unit is valid. With a hypothetical 100%vax rate, 100% of intensive care unit visits and deaths will be vaxxed individuals (vs the 30% vaxxed deaths currently), the vax does not give immunity. Isolation of unvaxxed to their homes should skew the forward numbers more in the direction of vaxxed being the burden on the healthcare system and give a truer overview of the prophylaxis of mrna vaccines. Regarding deaths, I cannot find a summary of vaxxed vs unvaxxed deaths since vaccination started nor since herd vaxxed rate was achieved, this would be useful. On the daily reading of Ministry of Health stats 4/6 recent deaths were vaxxed 2 unvaxxed, age and comorbidity were factors. Seperately and for cinsideration of preventable deaths, Singapore has over 2200 smoking related deaths per year (thus 142 covid deaths and 4400 smoking deaths since covid emerged in Wuhan) yet cigarettes remain on sale and smoking legal. The impact of reducing deaths through eliminating smoking would of course not be seen for decades but is worth considering as second hand smoke also contributes to lung health issues in society. Restrictions on sugar would also reduce death from diabetes. Diabetes kills nearly 4400per annum (thus 8800sonce covid broke out). Ref on covid- http Over the last 28 days, the percentage of local cases who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms is 98.4%. 659 cases required oxygen supplementation and 66 had been in the intensive care unit.

I think once we have easily accessible antiviral pills, we'll likely be able to just say goodbye to covid, and say hi to endemic. Vaccination has ran it is course in the sense that the people who are willing to take it would have already taken it by now. At this point there's really nothing we can do on the vaccination front. The next step would be to get the anti-viral pills into mainstream usage and once that is done, the spread wouldn't matter as anyone down with it can be assured of a good chance of very low impact from covid. The measures we have in place are already ineffective . I struggle to think of a single measure that is actually limiting the spread of covid. Social group sizes. Indoor masking. A heightened awareness of hygiene (I know this isn't a measure but it is something good that we should really take out of this situation). They do not stop the spread to large degrees, but a combination of them does some to help with the situation. Measures aren't going to be all or nothing, they just help the situations in degrees, and even if they do not stop spread entirely does not mean it does not help reduce it. As for the statement in bold, I do like to point out Denmark's current covid numbers since their releasing of every single restriction they had.

Let me give you an example, I respect indian culture and their own way of doing things but personally i dislike the smell of strong spices. I have no issues with my neighbours doing it, i can simply close my door and on my aircon and understand everyone have their own rights and preference of doing things. Now put it in a context i want to rent a room out and usually this also means the kitchen is shared for the tenant. Given i dislike this strong spice smell, why will I want to rent to a tenant that have a high likelihood of cooking such spices and potentially make me unhappy with it? Afterall, this is my own living space. This is just an example, many other things is possible, a muslim family may not want to rent out to a non muslim due to many difference in practises. They wont want their kitchen to be kept with Non-Halal food. Lastly just a personal example, since what i rent out is the whole flat, i do not really care that much on the race or gender of the tenant. There was once i rented to an indian tenant, and while i not entirely sure, i believe its part of either their culture or religion to burn a oil lamp at home. After 2 years when they return the flat, the spot where they burn the oil lamp badly damage my tiles and i have to replace it. I mean it is not exactly hard but it is just not convenient. There may be people who do not wish to go through that hassle. That being said, they are a nice family and i enjoyed working with them during the 2 years so i am not complaining, just sharing an experience. | OFF | UNT | NULL

( because) Article 12 Right to Equality Before the Law The Applicants further asserted that the law contravened Article 12 of the Constitution, because it unlawfully discriminates against sex between men (as opposed to homosexual or heterosexual activity involving women) and because it targets conduct in private which does not harm public morals. Article 12 provides that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law . The Court applied the reasonable classification test established in Tan Cheng Bock, which requires the Court to assess whether the demarcation of sexual conduct based on gender is so unreasonable as to be illogical and/or incoherent, having regard to the provision's purpose. The Court rejected the Applicants' argument. It drew attention to Loh J's interpretation of the reasonable classification test from Lim Meng Suang, which affirmed that legislation that divides the population into specific classes is not inherently unlawful. Rather, the critical concern is that like should be treated alike . The Court then found that it was neither illogical nor incoherent to omit sex between women from the provision's scope, because the purpose of s 377A was to safeguard public morals and reflect societal morality by specifically criminalising sex between men. Since the Parliament is the appropriate body to make determinations as to public morality, the courts should not bear responsibility for making such determinations. The Court also relied on the existence of distinctions between women and men throughout Singaporean law to justify his conclusion. - Human Rights Law Centre's summary of the High Court's decision in March 2020 (regarding 377A specifically). people have thought of this already, and in fact it is pretty common to use Article 9, 12 or 14 as a constitutional challenge.

1. Some research have mentioned that the cost of your wedding is inversely related to the length of your marriage. 2. Sales of balance, resale home, 3 room flat etc. Remember you do not have to live in tiong bahru or queenstown. The average price of a 3 room flat outside of those areas are around 250k to 300k, maybe capping out at 350k. With a downpayment of 25% which is around 90k and 210k in loans for 30 years @ 3% the monthly payment will be 900. A standard university/ polytechnic grad pay would be around 2.5k to 3k so together it will be 5.5k. 38% of 5.5k is 2090 which means you would have around 1.2k in your cpf left over.

But my point is that at a age below 21, when a person might still be undergoing puberty, and that their treatment might not be entirely successful, and that there might be complications down the road. do not you think the doctors/surgeons involved have more medical information to make that determination?

Your point seems like needless concern over something that is already subject to very tight restrictions. it is not easy to get HRT or serious. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am just saying that the analogy is valid. All the preparation stuff you mentioned is no where near the level of preparation anal sex does How would the analogy be valid if nobody drinks through their nose while plenty of straight people also engage in anal sex? Anal sex also does not require as much prep as you are thinking of, just for your information. All I am saying is, the analogy is valid. Because after all you are using the wrong organ for it. Mentioning other cases is sort of a whataboutism. The anus would be the wrong organ for procreation, but who's arguing that? But people engage in anal sex for recreational sex, so it is the right organ for the job for many couples. Just like the mouth or fingers for other forms of sex. Do people drink from their noses recreationally? | OFF | UNT | NULL

Its just that I have come across articles where a person decides to undergo HRT or serious at a young age, only for the treatment to not be entirely successful, that they regret making the choice to do so or they do not have the funds to continue the treatment What age would that be? Most countries restrict it to those aged 17 and above. Also, there is no medical procedure that has a 100% satisfaction rate. More importantly, nobody is saying otherwise about HRT or serious. The medical consensus is that while not everyone will have their dysphoria be alleviated, it still represents the best tools at doing so in patients it is indicated for. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Choy Hon Tim was former Deputy Chief Executive (Operations) of the Public Utilities Board (PUB). He had been bribed by a businessman who was once employed at PUB as a clerk. Choy's relationship with the businessman developed in 1974 when the latter became a sub-contractor to PUB. It started in 1977, when the businessman sought the assistance of Choy who was then a PUB engineer, to ensure the smooth laying of high-tension cables in his sub-contract works with PUB. In return, Choy was given 20 per cent of the company's profits in cash. This arrangement lasted up until the businessman shut down his sub-contracting company and migrated to Australia. In 1983, the businessman approached Choy again, who was then the Acting Chief Electrical Engineer, to set up a 'consultancy service', providing advice to international contractors interested in doing business with PUB. The role of the businessman was to provide consultancy services to prospective contractors while Choy provided confidential and privileged information concerning PUB tenders. He was also to provide assistance wherever necessary to ensure the smooth running of projects after they were awarded to the contractors. This lucrative partnership earned the businessman a total of $63,377,744 and of this sum, $12,240,613 went to Choy. The payments were made via cheques or cash orders payable to Choy's former and second wives. The case was opened for investigation by the CPIB in 1994, and with the help of Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). According to CPIB's investigation, Choy had as much as $13 million stashed in a Hong Kong bank account under his second wife's sister's name. As his sister-in-law was not a high-earning individual, there was no way she could have accumulated that amount of money. Choy Hon Tim soon fled the country. He was eventually brought back to face legal action in Singapore. On 27 October 1995, Choy Hon Tim was charged in court for criminal conspiracy and accepting bribes totalling around $13.85 million, and was sentenced to prison for 14 years. To date, the total amount of bribes he had received remains the largest total amount of bribe monies involved in Singapore's history. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Ng Boon Gay - he is actually still kind of employed by Singapore Government so it isn't true what Straits Times said. He is quietly the Deputy Chief Executive, Singapore (Operations) of Certis. Certis originated from the Guard and Escort unit of the Singapore Police Force (SPF), which was separated from the SPF as the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO) in 1972 as a statutory board with a monopoly over most areas of the local private armed security industry. Former Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) chief Ng Boon Gay, who was acquitted of corruption last year, has been retired from public service effective Wednesday. The decision by the Public Service Commission follows the conclusion of internal civil service disciplinary proceedings and was made in the public interest , said a Home Affairs Ministry spokesman on Wednesday following queries from The Straits Times. The 47-year-old former Public Service Commission scholarship holder had faced four counts of corruptly obtaining sexual favours from Ms Cecilia Sue in exchange for furthering the business interests of her then-employers. The trial had gripped the nation early last year for saucy text messages between the duo. | OFF | UNT | NULL

RSS Courageous incident - this led to the Chief of Navy being demoted to CEO of MPA (role created just for him, prior to him there is no such role) but he later he became a Minister but eventually stepped down and is now in China for MFA. He also told us his body parts are all working , to a question nobody asked In politics, you need a tender heart and a thick skin, not a hard heart and thin skin. I think my heart, my skin, like all my body parts, are fine. MPA findings blame the collision on the OOW. The collision between AI and RC was caused by errors of judgement in assessing the situation and the wrongful application of the Collision Regulations on the part of RC. Although the trainee OOW had the control of the ship , the trainee was at all times under the OOW's supervision. According to RSN regulations, the OOW of RC was in charge of the watch and not the trainee OOW. As such, the OOW was fully responsible for the safe navigation of RC. By not intervening, the OOW had shown that he was either not fully aware of the situation around him or had wrongly agreed with the actions and instructions given by the trainee OOW. Thus, the OOW of RC had either failed to keep a proper watch or had made similar errors of judgement as the trainee OOW. When RC stayed in the eastbound lane after making a you turn from its original course of 050 , this was an operational decision that was meant to keep RC closer to Horsburgh Lighthouse. In itself, this would not have led to the collision if RC had maintained its course and speed. It was the following errors of judgement that led to the collision. a. RC's initial alteration of course to port which was carried out in order for the vessel to keep closer to Horsburgh Lighthouse but which resulted in a risk of collision with AI b. RC's decision to cross the bow of AI and the assumption that AI would not alter its course and because. RC's subsequent succession of small alterations of course to port which negated the actions taken by AI. The collision was not caused by any of the following factors a. Failure of machinery or navigational equipment on either ship b. Movement of other ships in the vicinity because. Insufficiency or fatigue of crew on the bridge of both ships d. Weather and tidal conditions e. Failure of any aids to navigation in the vicinity | OFF | UNT | NULL

Transcript of the speech Thank you very much, Mr President. We are meeting today in a historic emergency special session because the UN Security Council was unfortunately unable to discharge its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of the veto cast by the Russian Federation, which is regrettable. We welcome the convening of this emergency special session, as it allows all countries, especially the small countries, to raise their voice, to state their views, and to register their concerns in this universal organ of the United Nations. Mr President, Singapore has always taken a consistent position on the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries. Singapore is a staunch supporter of the rules-based multilateral system and of the United Nations. The unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation is a clear and gross violation of the fundamental norms of International Law and of the UN Charter. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. This is a matter of principle for all small states and a matter of fundamental importance to all members of the General Assembly. For a tiny city state like Singapore, this is an existential issue. A world order where 'might is right', or 'the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must', would be profoundly inimical to the security and survival of small states. We cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was a result of, and I quote, 'historical errors and crazy decisions', unquote. We simply cannot accept such an argument. Such an argument and rationale would go against the internationally-recognised legitimacy and territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore. This is why Singapore condemns, in the strongest terms possible, any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext. We deplore the Russian Federation's special military operation against Ukraine, both its operation in the Donbas region and the broader land, air and sea attacks across Ukraine, including on Kyiv, the capital city. We also note with great sadness and regret, reports of the growing number of casualties and the loss of many innocent lives as a result of this unjustified attack and act of war. We have taken note of the UN Humanitarian and Emergency Relief Coordinator's comments about the scale of the humanitarian assistance required to help those affected and we call for safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and all those in need. Mr President, we reiterate that the sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, must be respected within its internationally-recognised borders. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has stated that he considers the actions of the Russian Federation to be a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We agree with the Secretary-General entirely. Let me repeat We agree with the Secretary-General entirely, and we support his call for the Russian Federation to withdraw all its troops from the territory of Ukraine and for the responsible actors to immediately cease all hostilities and prioritise diplomacy to address all issues peacefully in accordance to the UN Charter and International Law. We also support the good officials of the UN Secretary-General to be deployed in any way possible to facilitate diplomatic contacts and negotiations. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I cannot speak for NSW and Portugal(though Portugal to my understanding still has social distancing + mask mandates) but Denmark absolutely do not have even a similar caseload to Singapore's. It has since surpassed both the US and UK's own peak in covid cases per capita, and hospitalisation increased by 50%. Even a Danish official has mentioned that they shouldn't necessarily be a model for other countries, as healthcare systems vary by country. I highly doubt Singapore for example, can handle an additional 50% load. | OFF | UNT | NULL

The headline is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to restrictions - it is actually a lot more comprehensive than these two measures - no dining in (by extension, no wedding banquets) - gatherings capped at 2pax - 2 distinct visitors per household per day - WFH as default - no indoor exercise classes, individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities - no facials, saunas, singing, musical instruments - events scaled down to 50 w/o pre-event testing, 100 with pre-event testing, including congregational, worship activities and MICE - operating capacity of attractions down to 25%, museums and libraries 20% If it looks like a circuit breaker, quacks like a circuit breaker, then. | OFF | UNT | NULL

brother it is a percentage over the said group not slice of the pie. Using percentage is okay, it just a matter whether the sample has enough statistical power. I am more concerned about the numbers on the last few age groups whether the death was mainly caused by covid or not. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am in the UK so a gun is very unlikely. I am not saying intervene by just immediately jumping in swinging. I mean having the confidence to at least try de-escalate the situation. you are right though - there's always a risk it turns out horribly. But if this was happening to you - then you'd want someone to help out. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I completely agree with you. I never understood the perennial complaints about Singapore being excessively focused on grades, money or general materialism. Singapore is a great place for startups 1. Taxes are low. 1. There is significant Government funding/incentives/rebates for new companies. 1. Most young adults stay with their parents so that creates a huge safety net for entrepreneurs. 1. A large number of VCs and like-minded entrepreneurs are based in Singapore. 1. Easy access to South East Asia and China (especially with the political situation right now in HK). Above and beyond that, we also have Unprecedented peace. We are almost nearly a century away from the last global conflict. Advances in medical science means that people are living longer and healthier lives. The recent covid pandemic has resulted in a resurgence in interest in anti-ageing and longevity research given that age is a significant co-morbidity. Being able to reverse ageing will allow us to cure all age-related diseases such as cancer, heart diseases and Alzheimer's. A lot of work is being done behind the scenes to tackle climate change. Plant-based or lab-grown meat may result in a reduction of fertile land being used to grow meat instead of trees which can reduce greenhouse gas. There is an increased acceptance and move towards renewable energy - many countries have given themselves a deadline to move away from ICE cars. AI and automation. Low level menial work will be automated away. If this comes with some form of universal basic income, perhaps we can move away from the work-to-survive mentality. We also see many countries exploring WFH or 4-day work week models. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Throughout the whole national service, a combat fit fulltime national serviceman has 2 to 4 live firings with 32 bullets each. So in a 16 day basic rifle training , a US Army solider fires more than six to eight times more bullets than an fulltime national serviceman does in two years. I wouldn't be surprised if a US Army infantryman who was just a recruit is a better soldier than an fulltime national serviceman corporal about to operationally ready date. The difference in training is just huge. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am also a social conservative and a woman. There's a lot of things going on in your statement. I think what you mean is as a man/woman we cannot ignore biological tendencies, not gender roles which is socially constructed and changes with time. I agree that I share a similar issue with the LGBTQ spectrum and how some people are liberally changing their genders according to how they feel, and expect others to accomodate to that volatility. However like you've pointed out, gender dysphoria is a legitimate medical issue that Singapore has actually recognised quite early on. And it is one with few solutions. I believe if trans people do not have the right as you say to impose their reality/medical issue onto other people, then it is absolutely within their right to be able to surgically and medically be able to change their sex. In this case, if accusations are true then this particular student's transition should not have been interfered with from a solution perspective. Although like you I disagree with the adherence to pronouns before transition, which also shows commitment that differentiates it from the people who are simply just doing it for whim. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I always remember this situation and later in life when I find myself in an uncomfortable situation, I will say NO firmly and walk away.

I say teach that there are really responsibilities that come with sexual intercourse, and that there are many potential joys yet pains and challenges that come along with it. but teach it when the young person is able to reason and comprehend, not too early. giving the freedom of choice without expectinf the cost of it is dangerous. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Good one. Some of us compare this to 2003 - Iraq. I was working the UK then and most of the people there were against the invasion of Iraq.

I moved out when I was 25. Renting isn't throwing money away if it gives you peace of mind and improved mental health. I concur with the guide except that I always ended up in a flat with landlords. There are some pros to landlords the good ones clean the toilet for you, and I also know some that cooks for their tenants just because they liked them. Of course it is going to be a hit or miss. I rented 5 places in the course of 15 years and encountered two bad landlords. Sad to say but if the landlord is disabled or give off vibes of OCD, it is better to give them a pass.

I am a novice, just a (previously) enthusiastic gym goer. So my unprofessional personal opinion is that we can consider resistance band training. This reddit thread is one starting point for learning about it http My additional two cents of caveats Buy good quality bands. There are different qualities of resistance bands being sold. Based on my googling and reading reviews, many bands snap with minimal use. Also, many of the exercises involve anchoring to an external fixture e.g. a door, but this may damage the fixture/cause injury if the external fixture is not strong/the anchor is not fixed properly to the door. This is not a sponsored post. For me, I bought a set of Undersun resistance bands (google Undersun resistance bands on amazon), which from reviews (amazon, reddit, etc.) seem to be of a good quality. (I've only used them three times so far, so cannot speak from personal experience how durable they are, but they do seem to be of ok quality.) I do not use the door anchor, as I do not want to damage the doors, or risk having the door fly out when I am doing a chest fly and have it smack me at the back of my head.

Likely a very unpopular opinion but because I am part of a so-called minority, just thought I wanted to share a different perspective amidst all the scolding of anti-vax idiots . Myself and some of my family members are only partially vaccinated so far (one dose or not yet 2 weeks after second dose) because we chose to be vaccinated with Sinopharm instead of the mrna vaccines, simply because we are just more comfortable with the inactivated vaccines that have been used for other past treatments. Say what you will about experts' comments and evidence about the safety of mrna vaccines, I am no expert to challenge it, but I do not think it is unreasonable to choose a different vaccine that my family and I feel more comfortable with, as opposed to the mrna ones that the majority are taking. it is not even that I do not want to get vaxxed, I just want a different vax. Any take on such a view? We do not think that vaccines are ineffective, nor think that it is some chip that Government tries to implant in us to track us or whatever. I have also taken other vaccines, such as the one against cervical cancer, so I do not doubt the effectiveness of vaccines in general. It is simply a matter of preference that we chose Sinopharm as opposed to the ones in the national programme, and I do not think it is a luxury to be able to have a choice. The problem is, people who follow the news might know that Sinopharm arrived in Singapore only in late Aug to early Sep, and the days following its arrival, you might also have seen news about the high demand and overwhelming response for it. My family members and I made appointments with multiple providers of it but to no avail because appointments were booked so quickly that I wasn't quick enough to be part of the first batch to receive it. My second dose is in slightly under a week, meaning that it would be about 3 weeks before I am counted as fully vaxxed. I can accept the dine-in restrictions, and while it means some inconvenience or not having the occasional luxury of dining at certain establishments, it does not exactly affect my way of life. But to restrict entry into malls, means I cannot takeaway food from anywhere but hawker centres/coffee shops or standalone outlets - which are rather inconvenient from my school and home - nor go grocery shopping, many of which are in malls. Nevermind that I cannot buy takeout from certain food outlets in malls, guess I'll cook more often, but wait, I cannot go grocery shopping. you are going to tell me that I can go to standalone outlets, but as aforementioned, there are none near my school or home. I would have to go out of my way to carry out these basic activities and increase travel time and exposure. I see comments like I cannot go grocery shopping! Well then get vaxxed you idiot Do we not remember that it takes over a month for the entire regime? And at this point in time where the Government boasts about over 85% vaccination rate, and the measures never being this extreme in the past yet is such during a time when they say we are making progress, is it really necessary at this very moment? As Sinopharm was not part of the national programme, it was a lot more inconvenient to get it, but inconvenience aside, it was nearly impossible to during the initial stages because of the overwhelming demand. I am just a student that still has to go to school almost everyday, buy lunch or dinner back occasionally for my family, and go grocery shopping on my way home sometimes. Our way of life is thoroughly disrupted and made nearly impossible to carry out because of the new restrictions. And this all boils down to the fact that our preference was Sinopharm, which causes us to be fully vaxxed later than others. Is it wrong that we had a different preference? If you think it is a sin, then you do you. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am sorry for you, for everything you said. Your experience is heartbreaking and the maturity and depth with which you speak about it is testament to your strength and intellect. Singapore is a wonderful place. But from my (white) perspective of living there, the enforced idea of 'racial harmony' was deeply oppressive. It seemed to force everyone to stick on a smile, and to accuse anyone who suggested things were NOT harmonious of threatening that very harmony the person was saying did not exist. Harmony comes from being free to discuss problems, and from anti-racism being actively taught. You cannot just teach 'we all get along here' when for so many that is patently untrue. OP, you are under no obligation to fix this problem because you are clearly already exhausted. But you could - if you wanted to - get this letter published more widely in the ST or in We The Citizens.

Well Singapore is one of the very few societies out there that favors women. Mandatory Conscription - The big one. All men are forced to enlist for two years in the military, or be sent to prison. Laws that specifically favor women - Easier to get child custody, men can be caned here but not women, male r pe not legally recognized here, automatically assumed at fault during any accusation (see recent case of that doctor), child custody automatically awarded to women over men, men can be made to pay alimony but not women, women's charter, the fact that there's no Male equivalent of AWARE should say something. Equal Opportunity - Singapore is one of the few countries in the world without a significant gender pay gap - I'd say women actually have an advantage over men at the workplace due to having 2 years more work experience. Compare that to some countries where women wear the burqa and literally not allowed to drive alone, and you'll realize how stark the difference can be in contrast. Social Advantage - This one is a bit more subjective but I think women have it better socially too - besides a stronger support network, others are more empathetic (no talk of manning up, no toxic masculinity, not worried about being perceived as a creep), and arguably easier relationships in traditional Asian societies. To elaborate - Because of cultural baggage meeting the ideals of the west we get a weird mash of gender roles here, we support both feminist empowerment movements (women can do everything equally well!) and also traditional ideals of the guy being always expected to take the initiative in any relationship, be the provider of the family, make sacrifices etc. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Ya, they ask fulltime national serviceman to help out with call centers but if people are just more understanding, and not I call MP then you know at the slightest issue, we could be so much more efficient. The protocols can also use more works to be honest.

Not to disregard the cynical realpolitik of our joining the Coalition of the Willing but a war of regime change is different from a war of territorial acquisition. An analogy would be if the US invaded Iraq with the casus belli of partitioning off an independent Kurdistan. it is quite telling that the US made no threats to the territorial integrity of either Iraq or Afghanistan. Regime change is not the same as a threat to national integrity- the former is at least sort of within the rules of the Westphalian System we all theoretically play by, the latter is not. The only major war of territorial change post World War Two I can think of is the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War/Bangladeshi War of Independence which was in any case intervention in an ongoing conflict in a nation that was relatively new and had no geographical logic. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I'll respond. Attacking from the south isn't really feasible.a sizeable landing force would be VERY visible on radar. Then its a simple matter of bombing them out of the sky. it is not like normandy where you zerg the coast. Why do you think singapore has the most advanced airforce in the region. Simple so we can scramble more and faster jets than anyone else, which means we rule our skies (we literally control it now for air traffic purposes). So IF someone tries to do a souther approach, it'd be like Russia amassing east of donbass and north in belarus. They'd be seen and well any incursion into our waters wouldn't be adviseable. Now what you should be really asking is do our generals have the balls to call the necessary action even with all this intel? I do not want to denigrate but i think many people here would be hard pressed to say confidently that we have generals who would dare to push the button first. But maybe Ukraine is the wakeup call. Our neighbours might just do the same thing. (They have tried before, can check out my other comment). Our recent experiences with the johor ship incursion is somewhat annoying. But one boat does not an invasion force make. It is unlikley that the ships stationed here from the US will do anything. Most are also not really combat ships. So no i do not think anyone will come to our rescue. Singapore is pretty much in our own. I honestly think we have a better prepared reservist force than our neighbours so we'd at least be able to shoot back. Our airforce and navy are mostly professionals so that is our spear point If we have to activate the army then its a matter of defending to the last man. As a singapore guy will i do that, yep. And i hope most singaporeans (esp the men) will do likewise Also before anyone says anything. The lack of munitions on the part of the Ukraine army is quite telling.

I do not understand the focus on unvaccinated. it is very clear that the vast majority of those unvaccinated are medically unfit for vaccination. I do not have direct proof of this of course, but I am inferring from every compulsory vaccine in Singapore and their vaccination rates. BCG is the only vaccine that has full coverage in Singapore, in the 99-100% range. Every other vaccine including MMR, polio, Hib, Hep B, and tetanus have a coverage of 90-95%. covid currently have a coverage of 83%, however this includes 10% of ineligible children. This makes the 12+ coverage of covid vaccination be at 92%, within the 90-95% range. For partially vaccinated, this is at 85%, which is equal to 94% of adults. This means that those who choose to not vaccinate is estimated to be around 1% of the population. I do not know how these measures can improve our situation. | OFF | UNT | NULL

As a transgender person in Singapore, I feel like the best thing to come of this is awareness. We're rarely talked about as anything more than caricatures, and many forget that we are humans too. Being transgender is ultimately just a small part of who we are. Many people I've met mean no malice toward me, they are just ignorant. Unfortunately, in Singapore, mass media has not done much good for the trans stereotype. I personally see this as a chance to stand up and be heard and try to change that. it is a good time to show (if you genuinely believe in it) your acceptance for transfolk so that our society can see that it is not just some trendy liberal movement. Hopefully transfolk who are still in the closet can see that there are more people out here who are willing to accept them and stand up for them than they might think. The Government ultimately needs its people, so social acceptance comes before any kind of legislative action will be considered. I am sympathetic for Ashlee's story but we still have a long way to go as a society, and in the meantime we still have to play by its rules. I am sure that the protestors knew what they were in for as well they've gone and helped throw attention on this issue. I do not think we should get angry about the arrests ( that is a whole other issue about free speech to get into) but instead use this as a platform to spread positivity. I do not want special treatment at all. I just want to live a normal life as my preferred gender. I think people forget that. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Many redditors who simply deride people who seek treatment at a&e for mild symptoms probably should reflect the complexity faced by those who have mild covid. The symptoms may be mild initially, but things may escalate from zero to hundred within a short span of time. Should the individuals or their families take a gamble and leave it to fate, especially during night time when nearby GPs may not be operating? I actually disagree you with this. Its more about staying calm. My baby developed covid on 15th of Feb after being on HRW, so we knew immediately what it was likely to be . She developed a 39. 5 degree fever in the night. She falls under protocol 1 of the guidelines, and the guidelines on when to go to hospital regarding fever are very clear- prolonged fever of above 39 for 3 days or more, or a fever above 40 degrees. Or, if you have breathlessness or chest pains. it is a five minute read. Only the people who are at high risk of their symptoms getting worse are picked up by ambulances. it is literally why we have such a protocol. Yes, it requires some vigilance on caregivers part- but that is part of the problem too- many people do not want to take that responsibility. Even if it happens in the middle of the night, there are many 24 hour clinics out there. that is a much better choice than going to hospital ER. As a parent, sick kids come with the terriotory- they fall sick every time they get vaccinated, and once they start preschool it is every few weeks or months. Fever should not really be something parents freak out about. I can certainly understand if parents are scared, but that fear is part of the problem | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am sorry, but the OP sounds like your the whole world is going up against me Singaporean who wants an expensive wedding, then complains about having to pay off their wedding loans. At the end of the day, alot of it is down to financial discipline and the choices that you make. Personally for myself - wife and I decided there was no need to.spurlge on wedding or engagement rings. We spent $5k total on both our wedding and engagement rings - for our wedding, we held it at a restaurant of 20 tables, each costs us about $900 per table. We made a profit on this - we did buy a cheap condo- under $900k. We refused to take a Reno loan- so spent onky $8k on renovations. No plans to buy a second one for investment - decide not to have kids - at 40 years old, I have about 13 months of my monthly salary in my savings account in case anything goes south. abit more locked up in investments. If we had kids, I'd imagine that we would be alot more stretched. But having Kids was something that we agree would not be in our best interest if we want to live comfortably. It is true that alot of us will continue working in our late 50s. But as Singaporeans, I think we are also quite fortunate in terms of public housing and public health care.

The basic tenet is that flights from places where the virus is spreading like wildfire should be banned. If that means conferences cannot be held in Singapore then so be it. That being said, I am not a fan of blanket bans on flights from countries but I am in favour of one from India right now is due to the circumstances prevalent in the country at the moment. In the US, people aren't dying by the hundreds due to poor handling of the pandemic at the moment. There is a brand new strain of the virus in India that seems to be extremely virulent and not a lot is known about it. It seems existing vaccines aren't protecting people against it. All these factors make it extremely dangerous to allow it into a country as small as Singapore. Once we have a better understanding of this new variant and how it can be combatted, the Singapore Government can relook the flight ban. by the way, I am not a PR. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Bold for effect. 'Existential issue for tiny state' Speech by Singapore UN ambassador Burhan Gafoor on sovereignty at UN emergency meeting on Ukraine, 28 Feb 2022 Thank you very much, Mr President.We are meeting today in a historic emergency special session because the UN Security Council was unfortunately unable to discharge its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as a result of the veto cast by the Russian Federation, which is regrettable.We welcome the convening of this emergency special session, as it allows all countries, especially the small countries, to raise their voice, to state their views, and to register their concerns in this universal organ of the United Nations. Mr President, Singapore has always taken a consistent position on the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries. Singapore is a staunch supporter of the rules-based multilateral system and of the United Nation s. The unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation is a clear and gross violation of the fundamental norms of International Law and of the UN Charter. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. This is a matter of principle for all small states and a matter of fundamental importance to all members of the General Assembly. For a tiny city state like Singapore, this is an existential issue. A world order where 'might is right', or 'the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must', would be profoundly inimical to the security and survival of small states. We cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was a result of, and I quote, 'historical errors and crazy decisions', unquote. We simply cannot accept such an argument. Such an argument and rationale would go against the internationally-recognised legitimacy and territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore. This is why Singapore condemns, in the strongest terms possible, any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext. We deplore the Russian Federation's special military operation against Ukraine, both its operation in the Donbas region and the broader land, air and sea attacks across Ukraine, including on Kyiv, the capital city.We also note with great sadness and regret, reports of the growing number of casualties and the loss of many innocent lives as a result of this unjustified attack and act of war. We have taken note of the UN Humanitarian and Emergency Relief Coordinator's comments about the scale of the humanitarian assistance required to help those affected and we call for safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and all those in need.Mr President, we reiterate that the sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, must be respected within its internationally-recognised borders.The Secretary-General of the United Nations has stated that he considers the actions of the Russian Federation to be a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We agree with the Secretary-General entirely. Let me repeat We agree with the Secretary-General entirely, and we support his call for the Russian Federation to withdraw all its troops from the territory of Ukraine and for the responsible actors to immediately cease all hostilities and prioritise diplomacy to address all issues peacefully in accordance to the UN Charter and International Law. We also support the good officials of the UN Secretary-General to be deployed in any way possible to facilitate diplomatic contacts and negotiations. Mr President, let me conclude by saying that the world is watching us as we meet today in the General Assembly. As members of the General Assembly, we have to act swiftly, firmly and with unity of purpose.Singapore is one of the main co-sponsors of the draft resolution that has been tabled for adoption in this General Assembly. Singapore will not hesitate to vote 'yes' on this draft resolution. Singapore will always vote to uphold the principles of the UN Charter, and to uphold International Law, and I would like to urge all members of the General Assembly to vote 'yes' for this resolution, and distinguished delegates, this resolution is not about taking sides, it is about upholding International Law and the principles of the UN Charter. The United Nations, distinguished delegates, is being tested today. It is important that all countries, especially the small states, send a clear signal that we are united for peace and we are united to defend the principles of the Charter and that we are united to uphold International Law.I thank you for your attention. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Honestly, as someone who has lived in Auckland, Sydney and Paris (for work, school etc) I can tell you this is a very glass half empty view of Singapore. Using Auckland as an example, but the below points apply to most large metro cities. 1. At least you have Government subsidised housing. Average dwelling in Auckland is $1M because most are houses with land. No, there aren't cheaper apartment options because of historical zoning issues that prevents their construction. Good luck saving for that 20% deposit when house prices increase at 7%+ per year. 2. houses are built with terrible quality. It often leaks and has poor insulation. This causes mould which leads to a bunch of chronic issues (this is well publicised but people do not have the money to fix it) 3. Public transport options are poor. The average commute is 40mins. You will also need to own a car to get around, this is roughly 8-10k worth of expenses each year 4. Crime rate is much higher than Singapore 5. Employers are only obliged to contribute 3% of your salary to the nz equivalent of cpf . But you still have to wait until you are 65 to withdraw it All that being said, nz is still a fantastic place to live because it has many positives that it shares with Singapore - rule of law, healthcare, education.

Have you uhhhh read the past history of Ukraine? And I mean really recent history, like XXI history | OFF | UNT | NULL

The issue is that most countries have land that they can sacrifice, burn, give away. How could Singapore do such thing? All the land here is not only scarce, but filled with material wealth and expensive infrastructure. The damage an artillery shell can do landing in a random ucranian plain is very different to the damage it could do in some industrial hub in Singapore. I understand that the point of Singaporean defense is deterrence, but the unique land limitations in terms of land for this country make it very difficult to survive an invasion. Notice that the same level of development of Singaporean infrastructure means that this country needs to maintain that level of wealth to survive as Singaporeans know it. Finally, the civil response of Ukraine is expected to be very different from the Singaporean. Yes, national service is a thing, but Singaporeans are pampered first world citizens used to live in one of the safest cities in the world, most have never even heard gunshots in the streets they live. Meanwhile, Ukrainian history is filled with violence. | OFF | UNT | NULL

1. Marriage and kids are optional, and even so, it is universal. If you want to have an expensive wedding and give your kids international school treatment, that is on you. 2. national service no choice. Also, juggling work and life is a universal thing. 3. Housing in Singapore is still relatively cheap as compared to the rest of the world. If you go to Australia, NYC, San Francisco, London, etc, the houses there are much more expensive. At least in Singapore, you have housing grants and the fact that foreign investors cannot anyhow buy HDBs. 4. people also have savings outside of cpf. it is not the only savings account you should have. 5. Average life expectancy is 83, so most people won't die in their 70s 6. Yes, perhaps we can do more for the elderly, but this post does not go more into it. Sickly aging parents is relative. I am lucky to have parents who can take care of themselves. I strongly disagree with the last line. Singaporeans are indeed blessed as compared to the rest of the world. Safety in Singapore is 1, healthcare won't bankrupt you, and standards of living here is relatively high. Saying that Singaporeans aren't blessed because of a hamster wheel (that is pretty much universal and more pronounced in other countries) is disingenuous. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Thank you for putting so much effort in creating this guide! And sorry for what you have been through, in a wsy, it helped you become an independent person you are today (albeit a very steep price /) but I am glad you are at a much better place now. in my opinion renting is costly yes, but sometimes we forget that our mental health and our emotional safety are of intangible value as well, which we hardly can put a price to it. When you have to bear the scar of being emotionally and sometimes physically abused, no amount of money can erase it. If we keep giving in, we would live a life not being whole and we would never be able to walk away from toxic relationships. But i believe we do have choices, just that there are things we must sacrifice. I would rather work hard and pay to come back to a place of my own and feel like a human being, not a punching bag for people gave birth to me because they can, and abuse me as their own stress relief. | OFF | UNT | NULL

To be fair, what he said exactly was Overall, our healthcare system remains stable and has been able to cope with infections . I am not saying that the point raised about healthcare workers being underpaid and overworked isn't true. But there is a big difference between saying our healthcare system is overwhelmed and our healthcare system is able to cope with infections . If the assessment is that our healthcare system is actually overwhelmed and not able to cope with the higher caseloads, then the solution is much stricter measures to reduce transmission (which nobody wants). it is not that easy to increase the supply of healthcare workers overnight. As others in this thread have pointed out, healthcare work requires years of training. it is definitely not as easy as hiring an SDA. Paying healthcare workers more is likely a step in the right direction, but you also have to take into consideration the effect this would have on our fiscal position on a permanent basis, especially with our ageing population. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I feel like perhaps on some level, I was brought up in an environment where people behaved this way - friends, classmates, teachers etc. (not so much my parents though - as immigrants, all they cared was that I stayed in school. ) Now that I am much older (30), what I've realized is - though our experiences are perhaps vastly different, we end up in the same place, mostly. it is not like I ended up a minister or some crazy high-achiever. I am in a 9-6 job like most others who did not go to so-called 'top schools'. Everyone's just trying to make it through. In the end, it does not matter. What matters is really how you sleep at night - how you treat others, how you treat yourself, how you deal with anything life throws at you. There's just no point in making others feel small. On another note, I've noticed this problem is so much more prevalent in singapore than in other countries just because this is such a tiny place, so everyone knows every other school and it becomes too easy to judge people based on stereotypes of each school's students. This must be the only country in the world where people ask 'which schools did you attend?' to know more about you. (School, not university or course!) | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am going to say from a layman's legal standpoint, your build-to-order/HDB flat was a matrimonial flat and to keep it you have to remain legally married which in Singapore's case a man and a female becoming husband and wife. You decided to change your gender which then makes this marriage void in Singapore since we do not recognize same-sex marriage. Given that matrimonial flats needs to be disposed off if the marriage is no longer valid, then your as per HDB policy you will need to sell the flat or it gets taken back by HDB. Now, I maybe wrong it maybe possible for someone who is above 35 to buy the remaining shares of the flat in a divorce from the other partner, but in your case, I am not sure. While yes, it is a terrible experience to go through but I do not think you have any real legal standing here unless policies changes. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Yes, from a financial/salary perspective they ARE both a form of compensation AND a requirement for working the job. I am NOT saying that I think their total compensation (including room amd board) is enough. I do not think it is enough. But I do think we should be honest with each other ablut what their full compensation includes. I think your suggestion would work in some cases and I wouldn't be surprised if some people do work that type of job description, but I doubt most people who hire domestic helpers in Singapore today would agree to that. Personally, I think room and board are fine, but 700 dollars is still much too low, and I would never hire someone for that amount. Perhaps doubling (or more.) that amount would be fitting. If a salary increase was mandated, the consequence would be, however, that a lot of domestic workers would have to go home against their own and their employers' wishes. Of course, the ones able to keep their jobs would get a better compensation. I am just saying it is not all black and white ) also, I feel normal people is a little bit a problematic term.

These regulations make sense earlier on to me. But now we have over 97% vaccination rate and hospitals are overwhelmed anyway. So what they set out to achieve did not work or at least isn't relevant anymore. that is the thing about the unpredictability of the human nature. The policy makers did not forsee people panicking and not reading the instructions broadcasted. Why bother continue enforcing regulations that are irrelevant/ do not work and for the sake of this 3%, inconveniencing 97% of us vaxxed people to have to continue using TraceTogether? I know TT's other purpose is contact tracing but Ministry of Health has already stopped contact tracing for certain protocols so it now seems to me just a fancy vaccine passport now. Well this you've to look from a medical standpoint. The virus is new. Scientist and doctors are still studying it. And to top it off it is mutating into multiple variants. dec 2021 article on covid variants ( http My best guess would be that since there is a multi-million dollar system setup for tracing. why not keep it around, collect data for research or isolation purposes if needed. Until the whole situation is 100% under control. Same thing with the migrant workers. It made sense back in 2020 when they were the majority of the cases. But since then, we are the majority of cases. Is it fair/necessary to coop them up, while we roam free (some even with covid)? This is complex. And I am kinda lazy to go read and research it. But off the top of my head. Think from a decision maker standpoint, not just on covid measures but taking into account every other factors. Example 1. Financial (who bear the costs? can we afford? look what happen when goods and services tax is increase) 2. Societal (human rights, riots, lock downs, etc), 3. Construction Industry (now build-to-order takes up to 7 years if another epicdemic occur with the workers, our young couples get engage at 20 but only have a home at 30+ ?,cost is a big factor here also when we have companies going under because of covid) 4. Manpower(now with the strain on healthcare, who's going to take care of the workers if there is another outbreak) I am do not agree or disagree with the measures taken since I did not really look into it. But just to iterate it is a complex one and there is no perfect/ fair solution. This kind of decisions are not made from Lee Hsien Loong sipping Mr. Coconut from Istana balcony and dreaming up random ideas. There are teams and teams and groups of people that are constantly debating, monitoring and drafting solutions. In fact if you've some good ideas on what to do, I believe you can write in. I've seen a guy on LinkedIn making some suggestions on the tracetogether app and it actually got implemented.

I've just brought my two young children to Singapore. We moved from a 3rd world country with failing infrastructure and rampant corruption. We had to live in a gated community with 24 hour guards, and we couldn't walk or ride bikes on the street outside because violent crime was so extreme that people who did so were often mugged. I personally knew a man who was stabbed to death for his bicycle. I had absolutely no hope for our future in that country. Unemployment there is over 40% If you do not want to have a family in Singapore, I do not think the location is what's stopping you. And there's nothing wrong with that.

The Smooth-coated otter population has held steady over the last few years, at around fewer than 100 individuals throughout the country. Each family occupies a very large territory, and they actively exclude trespassers. There have been many eyewitness accounts of vicious fights between otter families, with individuals becoming seriously injured or even killed outright. Even though the various families are producing pups every year, not all survive, and there are also deaths and disappearances. As for predators, we've seen large Malayan Water Monitors and Estuarine Crocodiles attempting to prey on otters, while an otter was once found in the gut contents of a Reticulated Python. And there's also the possibility of small pups falling prey to larger raptors like the Grey-headed Fish Eagle and White-bellied Sea Eagle. When you consider these predators, on top of the otters' fiercely territorial nature, it is really unlikely that we'll see an overpopulation. it is true that otters can become pests when they raid fish farms and ponds, but the issue is more about a lack of barriers. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Genuine homage to local flora n fauna complete with uwu bird. . That really caught me by surprise. 2. Skill tree flexibility. Always nice to have options. 3. Crafting, socketing and other modifiers are always welcome. Love that. 4. The food selection in the marketplace. Got hokkien mee damn shiok. Dislikes 1. Inventory management and equipping and buying and selling. Whatever stuff that had to do with items. Maybe cause still demo so no tutorial yet but I found it counter intuitive and not as straightforward as other arpg titles. Ended up selling stuff or buying stuff without meaning to. Maybe I missed the tutorial but if I did, I did not get the inventory system still. 2. Rune modifiers did not seem to add much to attack power. Felt underwhelming and I took a long time clearing simple mobs. 3. Character design with a little bit more differentiation in how the classes look 4. it is pixel art but hoping for a slightly more detailed render of the food pics. that is it so far. Got chance I play more and try out other classes. Keep it up brother! edited to take up less screen real estate. Sorry for long winded post. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Definitely! Even more so if you've done some research, planning, and budgeting. Not that you cannot wing it, but research gives you a better idea of what you are in for and whether it is sustainable. Aside from independence, ownership, and accountability, you will also be learning what you want or do not want for your future home. The worst thing I can imagine is spending my life's savings on home ownership only to realize I do not like living there. And that I did not know better at the time of purchase. I have heard of some friends who upon reaching adulthood transitioned into a very structured cohabitation with their parents (basically achieving this independence without moving out), but it is VERY RARE. Most of the time it is just too comfortable to have some meals cooked/laundry done/room cleaned for you, even if there's a lot of nagging and arguing to endure. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Let the self-proclaim personal finance advocate chime in. During your national service, do not waste your money and time clubbing. Instead, take up driving license before starting university or work. Wedding cost a lot so do save up and be reasonable with your expectations and budget. Project to make some losses so that you won't go W hotel when you can only afford Chinese restaurant (food might be better here). If you urgent for house, can do sale of balance flats, wait less than 2 years typically. Go meet your MP, if you have baby can get even faster. And choose an affordable flat is different from choosing the most expensive flat you can afford. If you downpay less or loan longer, you are going to have higher interest costs. You can and should opt to leave $20k in your OA so it does not get wiped out by your house down payment. Find a sweet spot for loaning, if you loan 15 years, you can pay less interest. if you loan 25 years, make sure you invest some money as well. Ownself balance between budget and savings. 23% of your salary goes to OA (after yours and employers contribution) if your flat is affordable, you should be able to get surplus after paying your mortgage. And with the $20k left behind, you should enjoy 1% more interest (this extra interest is credited to special account though). Again it boils down to affordability. After 25 years, if you did the above, you should have sufficient savings, do not forget to work hard so you get pay raise and bonuses as well. do not spend your bonuses on holidays, wanderlust is overrated when you cannot retire comfortably and be a well traveled beggar. You can retire if you did the above well, earn more, spend less, invest more. do not forget you got special account to add into your retirement too. You should be building your cpf account from day 1. Get yourself adequately covered for income protection, hospitalization, personal accident first, invest and savings plan come later. You should not require to sell back your flat if you build your cpf and your own outside cash properly. cpf is to help you get by, if you only rely on cpf when you retire then you are the reason why cpf needs to exist (assuming you make reasonable wages, low income do not really have a choice other than to raise their income to slowly crawl up sorry). This is why I posted awhile back on why we need to learn about cpf so we do not get to complain like this and be so easily rebutted by a Chao insorlen agent (myself). | OFF | UNT | NULL

I am just tired of having to argue this point over and over and over and over and over again with people. At this point everyone is entrenched in their own opinions - further arguments are unlikely to move the needle. Sure, yes, balance as between the rights of the collective and the rights of the individual is fine. I think this much everyone can agree. The issue is how to find that balance, especially in this uncertain circumstance. We have to take a step back and look at the situation - I think the main issue the Government is trying to avoid is to max out our hospital capacity. Already our hospital capacity is reaching maximum capacity already. Bear in mind that most of the persons admitted are unvaccinated individuals, most of whom have the choice to take the vaccine or not, and who are much more likely to get infected in any event. If the hospitals are maxed out due being occupied by mostly unvaccinated people, and, for example, an unlucky vaccinated soul wants to get admitted for treatment and cannot - does not the balance here this situation already lean in favour of the unvaccinated persons? We are respecting the personal freedoms of the unvaccinated in favour of the overall benefit to society (who comprise a supermajority of vaccinated persons). Are we letting disproportionately small number of people express themselves to the detriment of larger society ? Raising another example, the higher number of infections amongst unvaccinated persons will lead to the higher probability of vaccinated persons getting infected, due to increased number of infections in the community. Now, what I think the Government is trying to do is to, therefore, shift the balance back in favour of the majority of vaccinated persons. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Culturally there's less stigma against lesbianism than against male homosexuality, so it is the case that women tend to be more comfortable sharing about any attractions to women they've had or even exploring those feelings (or forming relationships that may be romantic but not always sexual). Whereas men who have had passing attractions to men are much less likely to ever talk about it, or strongly deny it. But this does seem to shift from culture to culture and across time (e.g. many more Gen Z guys identify as bisexual compared to older generations), so it is not likely biological in nature. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Do you have a source for that 75%? The stat I am familiar with is 1 in 3. I went to look it up again, and the highest number I found was 43.8% - where two thirds of those were at the hands of men from previous relationships, not existing lesbian relationships. When asking about female partners specifically, it falls to 29%, in contrast to 35% of straight women and 61% of bisexual women who had experienced domestic violence, 90-99% from male perpetrators. Strong correlations were also found between experiences of discrimination / homophobia and rates of domestic violence in same-sex couples across multiple studies. A few sources collected here http (Sorry that it is wikipedia, but it references peer-reviewed studies.) From my experience working with LGBTQ advocacy groups in Singapore, a key reason is that the victims have limited avenues to seek help, especially if they are not out and risk rejection from friends and family if they were to reveal their relationship by reporting assault from same-sex partners. The perpetrators may also threaten to out them to their family if they do not accede to their demands, which further traps them in that abusive relationship. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Currently tested positive for covid. Here's my experience. Day 0 Nighttime, after work. Kinda feeling weird, wasn't sure what it was. Happily got home, settled my things done and slept. Day 1 Morning, feeling sick now, but mild fever, not health threatening, so I did the art test. It was Positive. With a very bold 'T' line. Isolated myself, informed my family to do the tests for 5 days. Informed my supervisor, told me to inform the manager. Manager was understanding, told me to apply HL then do the test again in 72 hours. As per company policy and Ministry of Health guidelines, to stay at home and isolate myself and only go to the doctor if my health turns for the worse. At evening of day 1, I was having high fever, I took panadol and slept. Day 2 Feeling better. Tested myself again, still positive. I remember I was just worried about my family. Got red eyes and fever came back. I spent the day sleeping. Day 3 Fever gone. But having sore throat, but counted my blessings since I never got any body aches. Runny nose gone. Day 4 Sore throat got better, got so much phlegm though. Tested positive again. The 'T' line is still very dark. Day 5 It would be Monday, 28 February. Let's see how it goes. If your management is being draconian on these solvable issues, it is a no wonder why we're still in this mess, with 26,000 cases. If I were forced to go see a doctor just for MC or to do a art test in a Quick test center, when my sickness is only with mild symptoms, imagine how many people of the public I will be in contact with, that will be very irresponsible of me.

Good points, just to note that average live expectancy in Singapore is 83, so most will not have met their maker by the age of 70. Also a wedding ceremony is completely optional. Post also talks about filling up OA retirement sum, but this does not take into account any savings you have outside of the cpf. cpf is only 20% of everything you've ever earned (if you do not top up) and is meant to allow you to survive to old age if you have nothing else.

you are welcome! Nah, you are not the enemy. No one is just by virtue of their gender or any other characteristic they're born with. Which is also another thing I learnt with transition, because some things I thought were core parts of my personality turned out to just be a mix of hormones and how others saw and treated me. It set off a small identity crisis. I went from an extreme introvert to talking a lot, from fastidiously neat to a lot messier, from crying at every small thing to not really being able to cry, etc. My senses got slightly dulled, but in a good way, e.g. less sensitive to heat/cold like I mentioned. Some of it fell in line with gender stereotypes, others were the complete opposite. (I got worse at video games for some reason .) And unlike my first puberty which felt like I was becoming more and more like a stranger, transitioning and going through that second puberty on HRT felt like I was becoming more like myself. It was pretty fascinating. Ultimately I was still the same person, just experiencing things differently and thus responding differently. I think that is true for humans in general. Everyone behaves in the way that makes sense for them in their circumstances. So if a person or a group does things that seem irrational to you, it is more likely that they're just working with a different reality from yours, and they think you are the irrational one. What do you think of this group's actions? Do you support their actions, wish they have taken a less drastic route? If normal day to day is already harsh on a trans person, I cannot imagine prison would make that easier. In general, I do not support protests in Singapore, especiallywhen so much is at stake and any backlash could mean the Government snatching away the few hard-won rights we have. I am still scared of that, because there's nothing to stop them from, say, making transition illegal or deciding to start enforcing 377A. The majority of Singaporeans would be on their side. Yet at the same time, I am very proud of the protestors for their courage to stand up for themselves and others. Especially knowing they could end up in jail. Many people ask why they did not take another route, but other routes have been tried for decades to no effect. I know a couple of the protestors and have some idea of their background. Sometimes protestors protest because they have nothing to lose, and because nothing that can be done to them that is worse than what has already been done to them, for years, without anyone caring. And so they hope that if they protest now, it will help shed a light on those who are still suffering, and then others in future might not have to go through the same things they did. | OFF | UNT | NULL

To be fair, the EU and US have a roadmap out because of vaccination, not control of the spread. Even the UK 'success' is still having 1k+ cases per day, and the US is number 2 in the world in infections. I do not think having that degree of transmission is acceptable, and Government looks like they want to limit local spread to single digits. Singapore is still easily best in east asia in terms of vaccines per capita. All the healthcare workers and grandparents are safe, so our most vulnerable groups are protected.

In UK, my lecturer always emphasised on patient's right and ensuring the doctor-patient relationship and confidentiality is not taken advantaged off. Even as a medical student, you have to clarify and fully explain your intention before carry out any history taking or examination. We also require patient's consent before we could proceed. Compared to Singapore however, I find the local medical students here tend to be aggressive when handling the patients. Most patients here do not realised they could decline the lecturer/student's request and are often pressured to be examined. The medical students in NUH are impressive when it comes to medical knowledge but they do not possess the necessary soft skills and empathy when talking to a patient. From my observation, they tend to be clockwork in their questioning and often fail to realised when said patient is uncomfortable. Even some of the qualified medical professional are not exempted from such behaviour. During ward rounds, the doctor in charge would take the patient's chart and discuss extensively about the patient's disease without acknowledging the patient in front of him. I could feel the patient's uneasiness as his medical history is shared among the students and patients nearby without his consent. Sometimes patients are reduced into case history and statistic rather than a human being. Often in discussion, they would address patients by using their diseases rather by their name. In UK, we would get into huge trouble if we do not respect the patient's wishes but not much in Singapore. If you are planning to do elective in Singapore, you need to be wary about the competitiveness of local medical students. Due to limited patients in the ward, the students can get territorial when searching for interesting cases. In my group, there were some students voluntarily withheld information by asking the patients not to speak to other students besides themselves. I think it was selfish and insanely childish for people to keep interesting cases to themselves. I did not hang out much with the local students in my group and instead I joined with the international students. Most international students also expressed similar concerns like mine so we ended up became best buds throughout the whole elective although we were from different departments. One thing I do like about NUH is their teaching sessions. They hold a lot of seminars in the hospital and everyone including the doctors is encouraged to join the seminars. They have discussion on interesting cases, new procedures and techniques, drugs, etc. You could even join seminars that do not belong to your department. I think I probably joined like 3-5 seminars each week and you learn something new everyday. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Yep! Well, depends on your standard for fluency, but we're educated in English and most people speak in English in the working environment. Vocabulary can be limited for some folks whose families do not speak English at home, but for the most part you should be able to communicate in English with most working class Singaporeans without any major trouble. In my experience, it is mainly the elderly that experience some difficulty with English. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Well two cents as someone who moved to Singapore a few years ago. With all the problems that you listed (Singapore focused as well as global), this is perhaps one of the best times in the world to be alive. Life expectancy has never been higher. covid seems bad - but diseases that could have maimed you for life (and you'd never know what hit you) have been eradicated. The covid vaccines were developed, produced, distributed in a year and a half - by our ingenuity, drive and resources. This was easily a 5-7 year long process in the preceding decade and unthinkable to achieve in most of the previous century. For all the news of geopolitical tensions, we have the longest period of sustained peace ever in humanity's history. Think World War Two. Pay is stagnating and competition might be getting harsher when compared in a 5 year timeframe - but never has there been a better time to create new companies ( South East Asia has had more unicorn startups in the last year than in the preceding decade) or new technologies (R&D spending is at all time high and increasingly critical). And this is accessible to more people than ever and not just feudal elites (I grew up in a very middle class family in India and now run a early stage startup here in Singapore). Climate change is grave - but never before has there been a collective effort globally to combat it and our tools have never been more powerful (technologically or market driven by things like carbon credits). Advancements today have made clean energy (wind/solar) cheaper than polluting coal/etc - for the first time in human history and most new energy production installations today are green. This is cold comfort when you look at the pressures of having to perform well at school, meeting increasingly high cutoffs for good jobs and financial instability for the future in worsening economic conditions. But the world around us continues to change largely for the better in unprecedented ways - opening up opportunities and prospects unimaginable a few years before. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Singapore is smaller than Kiev, if anyone at all tries to make a push into our borders, they'll be at the Istana within half a day. does not matter how many men we deploy, there is only that much land to defend.

I wish our schools can provide better financial planning education. This life story makes a turn for the worse when the protagonist gets married. Financial mistakes which can be avoided. 1. Having an out-of-budget wedding. Budget, budget, budget. 2. Taking the biggest house loan offered, instead of buying something they need. A 3-room build-to-order flat is about $200k, a 5-room build-to-order flat is $400k. that is double the price. 3. Retirement at 55. Our higher-level cognition function does not significantly decline until after 70 years old. Retiring at 55 was expected when menial jobs were the norm and our physical fitness sharply decline after 50. Having a job is one of the best ways to delay the onsets of cognitive diseases like dementia. 4. Withdraw cpf in one lump sum. Fact The guaranteed returns on cpf is the highest in the market. It is better to have it earning interests to stretch out the value over the retirement. 5. Not buying sufficient medical insurance coverage when they were younger.

What's the point of your question? What's the point of studying? What's the point of working? What's the point of marriage? What's the point of anything ? Only you can answer those questions. We have our individual values and priorities. They probably are very different from yours and won't make sense to you. For me, having children is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Singapore is one of the best place to bring up a child. My children are well-loved and happy. They enjoy school and have great teachers and wonderful friends. Their laughter and antics bring much joy to us. The affluence of the society means that they will have good jobs in the future. The fully subsidized education means that I know they can complete their education up to secondary school. The well run healthcare system means that I can always trust that they will receive the best care if they ever need it. The security here means that I do not have to worry my hair out if they reach home late by 5 minutes. Their future is uncertain but bright. Global poverty is on decline. Access to information and education has been unprecedented. Famine is almost eliminated. We are in the period of the longest peace in human history. Gender inequality is on a constant decline in most parts of the world. Technological wonders which improve our lives in so many ways are being invented everyday. My live is much better than my parents. And my children's childhood is better than mine. They have already experienced more, travelled more, learnt more, loved more, laughed more than I did at their age. They have less to ask for and less to fear from. I cannot wait to see how much better their lives will turn out to be. Back to your question. What's MY point of having children? it is never about the point . There never was a point . Personally, it just is. it is not a decision matrix, a cost/benefit analysis, an equation or a having an end-goal. Maybe it is as simple as basic instinct to pass on my genes. Or maybe it is because I really like babies and children, and people in general. Or maybe the magic of bringing a new life together with the love of my life is irresistible. It was an easy decision for me because it feels right. But that is just me. Would I have made a different choice in another place or time? Probably or maybe not. My answer probably makes zero sense to you and won't help you though. Because I am I and you are you. You can never live my life and neither can I live yours. http http | OFF | UNT | NULL

The commentary by the guy is spot on. And i think every singaporean whos ever done guard duty wouldve done so as well. This is basically key installation protection as far as the police are concerned, taking a shot is basically what you are supposed to do. Except that we army boys were taught to take a warning shot first before the actual shot I am not sure if police have similar guidelines or if their pistol has only one shot so theres no ammo for warning etc. But given the distance between the defenders and antagonists, if i were the guard commander, id have given the order to shoot for sure.

I am very glad your experience sharply highlighted Singaporean's bad culture - elitism and superiority, which prompted you to write this post to further raise more awareness among redditors in Singapore. But unfortunately, our bad culture is not limited to just which school my child is attending, it is everywhere. Some common unfounded basis for discrimination includes jobs, nationality and race. We typically tried to ignore labour workers, such as bus driver or cleaners. Just recently, I have a Singaporean friend marrying a foreigner and the parents commented that it is a downgrade . This friend, at around 30 years old, said on a separate occasion that she will never allow her children to marry another race. ( Note These are my observations, not my actions. I am stating these as examples of discrimination that are still happening in Singapore, please do not downvote because of these examples. I voiced my dissent at the time of these instances.) So let's challenge ourselves to take actions to be more accepting of others. Smile and slightly nod your head down to bus drivers, cleaners and any person who serves you, or even better say thank you . Remove the mentality in yourselves that human can be segregated by any labels - schools, nationality, race or gender. We are all human, sharing this beautiful Earth with many other amazing living things. For OP, it will take courage on your part to reject being labelled. Coming CNY your relatives will be asking which school are you going to, and then sound their approval (or disapproval). Take it upon yourself to ask them what is their opinions and have an objective conversation with them. At the start of your junior college, there will be orientation and there will be far fewer students from other neighbourhood schools, take it upon yourselve to really interact with them and discover their individual characters and strength as a normal friend. ( Note I am just using your word, but labelling schools as good or neighbourhood is already discriminatory) | OFF | UNT | NULL

it is alright. No one is forced to do anything including reproduction. If elders have an issue, find a way to communicate to them. I know what you are having. You are having doubts. Every parent wishes a good future for their offspring. But the truth is the world is not perfect and so is Singapore. There will always be minuses to start a family. In the USA, parents sweat over school shootings, shotgun marriages, family debts. In India and China, parents sweat over competition due to their population sizes. In Europe, parents sweat over stepping back into a lower social class. In Syria, parents sweat over the meal next day. And so on. Having kids is not like Hollywood or Korean drama fairy tale. it is been a struggle everywhere. It just depends whether one is willing to take it on. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I'll concur here. The child truly is the one bringing the joy. It is a palpable and genuine feeling, not fleeting and illusory like one might derive off consumption. The perception is not one of burden, but a gift given to you. Like many, I put off kids to chase work and enjoy holidays, despite what my seniors explained to me about raising children. It turns out they were correct all along, and indeed perception about life and having them do change, as they gift you an untainted joy, and truly only seek your attention or company (biologically they are dependent on you for survival). You will see, the cliches are corny but not untrue about joy, it is just less easily described, but more experiential. In other words, do not worry about or calculate the burdens in a cost-benefit (if you alrdy have 10 kids please birth control abit ), just try it. The joy you receive cannot be bought/rented/experienced elsewhere. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Valid point in that every subway I've ridden had a separate, but nearby, emergency button linking to the driver's intercom that is what you'd want in this case rather than activating the emergency exit button (or you could just call the subway police's emergency number). The train then stops at an upcoming station and cops arrest the assailant I've seen it go down exactly that way in person. Also, I am not sure, but I assume/hope the emergency button would only altert the driver that there's an emergency, and the driver would still get to decide whether to stop immediately or at the nearest station. For example, if a trains on fire, you wouldn't always want to automatically stop immediately while you are in the middle of a long underground tunnel, rather than driving quickly to the next station/exits. | OFF | UNT | NULL

we all agree that covid is endemic and something that we'll need to live through. and a substantial population is fully vaccinated (and soon greater than 50% will be fully vaccinated) as such, the Government and conservative population needs to look further and longer-term than these short-term measures. it is time to look forward to the social and economic recovery that the world has endured for over 1.5 years. we need to learn to move forward and live with this virus - and there should be no need to shut down the country and society when the cases continue to have limited hospital impact. our barometer for success or failure should be revised - a few months ago, i read that singapore might stop recording daily case counts. that would be a good start to moving forward to designing new KPIs on how to measure covid impact by changing how we frame the covid impact, we can stop moving backwards | OFF | UNT | NULL

How many emergency medical services are assigned to a single ambulance? I do not think emergency medical services here sleep in their rig, unless there are no beds available wherever they're stationed. I also think the majority of emergency medical services in Hawaii do not have a set station, either, they get reassigned every so often. And I think the fire stations that do have emergency medical services have two ambulances? Not certain on that. And all emergency medical services live with family/friends/roommates. Are there dedicated living facilities for emergency medical services in other places? Hawaii is so expensive (less so than Singapore, however) that usually several generations live together, or numerous people live in the same house/apartment to save money. So epidemics tend to spread fairly quickly here, but probably not as quickly as mainland China. | OFF | UNT | NULL

That was my question. I do not know how Singapore operates, but at least in Hawaii 12 hour shifts are the only available shifts, you get 2 days on, 1 day off, then 3 days on, 2 days off. You cannot leave your shift until the next shift workers arrive (no matter how late they are) and they then use the ambulance you were just using. No one has their own dedicated ambulance, and it is 2 or 3 people (EMTs and a paramedic) per ambulance. There are extra rooms in the hospitals/fire stations for staff to sleep in, but they're for everyone working so they may not always be available when you want it.

Interesting POV. But for my grandmothers case, they said that each child is an extra pair of helping hands so they had more kids. They let the elders take care of the younger ones, reuse everything for them regardless of gender, etc. I am sure there were many ladies out there who did not wanted so many children then but did not have the choice to say no due to limitation of birth controls, tradition, family pressure and other reasons.

I get that the situation is bad in India, with the numbers reported being lower than the real count of cases and deaths, but why will a flight ban make sense? If I recall correctly our flight ban from china was not particularly effective because the virus came to Singapore via continental Europe and we did not quarantine people who arrived from the EU yet. Expecting a flight ban to solve the problem of the virus spreading in our borders is a bit too hopeful. Limiting arrivals from India to Citizens and PRs makes sense, plus they are tested multiple times before they are released from a 21-day quarantine. If anything, the spread of the virus from India might force us to quarantine travelers from other parts of the world for 3 weeks too. Fingers crossed this does not happen. | OFF | UNT | NULL

Well the main thing is we cannot only do with one without the other. Singapore's strategic value is also more nuanced than what we always like to oversimplify into, especially the geography argument. Another way to explore this issue is also to ask yourself for what reason would any of our putative enemies attack us? The moment war hits Singapore, Singapore will become useless. What are the occupiers going to do with a destroyed port and banking infrastructure, and a city swelling with millions of homeless? So if Singapore does not have any intrinsic value to conquer and occupy, then what is there? Singapore is a vital pillar of America's strategic presence in the western Pacific. While that also paints a big target on our back to the hegemon to our north, it also ensures that Singapore is a vital asset for the world's largest mililtary to defend. Adding on to this, the SAF is the final cog in the wheel. Even if our enemies are tempted to strike, they'll be thinking twice about the costs. So to sum up. Singapore's national defence outreach is simplified towards the cliche fight for your country. No one is going to defend you but yourself. Any other rhetoric might be too complex for conscripts to understand. But diplomacy is still a crucial component of Singapore's defence. Not just in terms of elevating our value in the eyes of the world, but the point being to avoid a fight to begin with. | OFF | UNT | NULL

ST just updated their article @ 1524h A student of River Valley High School (RVHS) was allegedly killed on campus on Monday (July 19) in an incident which saw staff initially ordering students to remain in their classrooms. The Straits Times spoke to a parent Mr Jacky Huang, a 43-year-old who works in the IT industry at about 3pm. He had rushed to the school after receiving a message from his daughter in Year One that there was someone allegedly wielding an axe in the school. Mr Huang showed ST the text message he received from his daughter at 11.50am, and a video of students running allegedly taken on school grounds. At about 1pm, a crime scene investigation van, an ambulance and at least four police vehicles were spotted at Boon Lay Avenue school compound. The back gate was closed off, but students who needed to leave the campus were o allowed to do so past 2pm. The rest were gathered at the school hall and briefed by school staff. RVHS has students aged between 12 and 18, as it offers the six-year Integrated Programme which allows students to skip the O levels and instead take the A levels in their sixth year. Staff who spoke to The Straits Times said there was supposed to be a lunch break at 1pm, but the students were told to remain in their classrooms instead. No explanation was offered. This story is developing and will be updated as more details are released. ST has contacted the Ministry of Education, police and the school for comment. | OFF | UNT | NULL

did not we have this argument in 2017 (or something similar) and there was a rough poll which was tilted in favour of keeping 377A (links below)? I agree that treatment towards the LGBTQ+ people should improve but I do not think breaking laws or going against the Government is the best course of action to go about this. There has been action taken by the Government to address the issue by protecting the LGBTQ society from hate speech and so I believe that our Government is open to change but rather the reluctance to change stems from society as a whole. What we should be doing at this time is to support those that had been hurt and give time for the Government to respond with proper polling, dialogues and legislation to address the issue as compared to having a vocal minority having more say over the quiet majority. This will be a difficult balancing act and I can foresee minor changes only that will have major pushback by the conservative and religious bases. whatever the case might be this is still a win for the LQBTQ society no matter what changes are made and so I would like to ask everyone to chill and carry on for the next few years and bring up the next phase of change when the time is right.

that is exactly what it is. If we wish to progress as a nation, we cannot rely on goodwill and hope that the People's Action Party will not one day decide to screw us over with their supermajority (aka the proverbial blank cheque). The potential for groupthink within a single-party majority also puts us at greater risk of a parliament that enacts policies which may not be the best for the country. This is why it is important to have alternate viewpoints in parliament, and why we should have more opposition MPs - Not for the sake of merely opposing the People's Action Party for opposition's sake, but to work together with the Government whenever possible, while also providing counterpoints whenever necessary to ensure that no segment of the population goes unheard or unrepresented. The key here is to vote in competent opposition, as opposed to populist opposition. That is what the WP has done so far, and I believe their track record in parliament speaks for itself. | OFF | UNT | NULL

In school, yes. Outside of school, I heard of a few during my times but never ever saw them on the news. Only 1 incident out of many slashing incidents I know got onto the news. One of my juniors in my CCA got half of his hand chopped off in a gang fight. It was in the news cause one hidden genius who stayed in the void deck found the severed hand and decided to keep it in the freezer so they can sew it back later. And they did sew it back. I tried searching for articles on it, cannot seem to find the article now. I would say, from my own experience, this is very common in the early 2000s actually. In my school, I know some people who hide knives and smaller parang in their schoolbags and even my teachers were scared.

Reading through some of the comments honestly make me sick.

Hello! Here for a friendly open minded discussion. I sincerely want to understand more what is wrong with that statement.

For me, they can encourage making babies for all I care, as long as they do not force me to, I am fine with it. that is why in my own interpretation, same could be applied to heterosexual marriages.

Birth rates are falling worldwide because of two things 1) women gaining financial independence 2) access to cheap, effective, and convenient birth control such as IUD, birth control pills, morning after pills, condoms, and vasectomies The two combined mean that sex no longer results in pregnancies if the woman does not want it to. And given the extremely high health and mental cost of a pregnancy and birth, it is very understandable why women would choose to limit themselves to 0, 1, or 2 kids.

Typical crew for an ambulance is 3, and are as such - Paramedic, the commander of the ambulance and has received the most medical training in the crew. Typically a regular, however sometimes it may be a Full-Time National Serviceman ( fulltime national serviceman) (note, this is rare, and is only because the fulltime national serviceman has had some medical education background prior to enlisting.) - Ambulance driver, another regular who is responsible for driving. They do not have paramedic certification, however they do have Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) certification and are able to assist the paramedic. - EMT, most likely a fulltime national serviceman with the said certification, they provide assistance to the paramedic. On some occasions a trainee will ride along with the crew, however for the main part the crew consists of these 3 personnel. Emergency ambulances are generally quite 'fixed' to their respective stations, so that means even if the ambulance finishes a call, it will return back to its station/firepost to await the next call. | OFF | UNT | NULL

One point I do want to add is that while CDL appears bigger than GRAB they too have their own can of works. To provide a small comparison, the ay it works is that 1. GRAB driver can rent his own vehicle or through them and typically it costs 55-65$/day. However Grab driver pays a commission of 20-25% to Grab for every ride but he does get back incentives based on his tier rating and number of trips etc. 2. A CDL driver pays almost double I.e. more than 120$ as rental per day, but he gets to keep most of the earnings. I believe for a full time driver the Grab model works better as his fixed cost is low and he only pays commission if he is working and driving and getting fares. For a CDL driver he struggles to meet his rental and can keep only the spillover after first making up for the rental. So if on any day a driver cannot work, the CDL model screws him pretty bad as compared to Grab. Also Grab provides additional businesses opportunities like deliveries which CDL does not. Overall both are corporates who care little about their drivers or the public. This CDL announcement also is but natural because drivers would start giving up the cabs if business drops. | OFF | UNT | NULL

This is for a hospital setting and the last line in the article sums it up - Our findings suggest that environmental contamination leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 transmission is unlikely to occur in real-life conditions, provided that standard cleaning procedures and precautions are enforced. If a person is carrying goods or stuff inside his luggage which presents a good environment for the virus to breed then it can be transmitted later because currently there is no fogging/uv treatment done for goods inside the luggage. Read this ( http Quote - However, the research from Australian agency CSIRO found the virus was extremely robust, surviving for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as glass found on mobile phone screens and both plastic and paper banknotes, when kept at 20C (68F), which is about room temperature, and in the dark. In comparison, the flu virus can survive in the same circumstances for 17 days. The study, published in Virology Journal, also found severe acute respiratory syndrome-Cov-2 survived for less time at hotter temperatures than cooler temperatures it stopped being infectious within 24 hours at 40C on some surfaces. It also stayed longer on smooth, non-porous surfaces than on porous materials such as cloth, which was found not to carry any infectious virus past 14 days Inside luggage which would be dark, damp and and about 20-25 degrees, there is a good possibility of the virus staying on.

How about not advocating for full openings I do not think ALL the people here advocating for more measures loosening is asking for EVERYTHING to be dropped. But I am addressing specifically the people that are . Dropping some of the more egregiously pointless measures can definitely happen, but there's definitely different views on whether some measures are or aren't pointless. And we're still releasing measures even at this point of the infection numbers, so it is more likely that more measures will be loosened when we get pass the peak. (I know the recent loosening is contentious but not the point here) Regardless, we still have to face the current issues the healthcare workers are facing. Your suggestions make sense and it is good points to be made in discussions like these.

Depending on the situation. I do not think the attacker just wants to disturb public peace. If you approach him I doubt that he'll start attacking you as well. He wouldn't want to get into more trouble he already is in. What I am saying is that there has to be a specific reason why the attacker went after that specific victim. If someone approached and tried to calm the situation down, it is unlikely that the attacker will then attack the intervening subject. But I do agree with you that bystanders may have just froze and had no idea what to do due to the sheer unfamiliarity to such situations. The fact that we're all watching this on video allows us to calmly interpret how the circumstance could been handled in a more appropriate manner, whereas the bystanders at the moment may not have such an environment to make quick decisions. | OFF | UNT | NULL

I recovered from covid 19 last month and only had one dose of vaccine before being infected.

If they openly and firmly confirm that your house is worthless after lease runs out, we will see a shift in the markets. like Khaw's parliamentary answer? I asked the Minister for National Development, during the 20 January 2014 Parliament sitting, what the value of HDB flats would be once their leases expire. I also asked whether the pace of SERS the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme will be fast enough to replace the flats reaching the end of their lease. ( http The Minister confirmed that the value of the flats will be zero at the end of their 99-year lease. He also indicated that the selection of sites and pace of SERS depended on factors including the site's redevelopment potential. Implicit in what he said was that SERS is not a scheme intended solely to replace old flats reaching the end of their lease. ( http | OFF | UNT | NULL

In other cities, people may have roommates living with them to reduce housing costs. I live in Silicon Valley. Let's just say that roommates bring down the rent of a room (with no attached bathroom) to the equivalent of Singapore rental for an entire HDB flat. it is not fun when you have to pay SGD 1.7K++ for a room (you share toilet and common spaces with 2-3 other people), when HDB rental in Singapore is like SGD2K for a 2 bedroom apartment. In fact, my HDB monthly mortgage is way less than the rental I pay for my place in the States. edit Before people say salary there high , let me just say that there's more to SV than just software engineers.

Having the appearance of an army marching, uniforms, saluting, officers, drill sergeants, cleaning the barracks and making beds, does not create a fighting force. Three times the USA tried to create an army, three times they melted away. War is a dynamic and black box thing with so many things that can go wrong. You only ever know whether it works when actual fighting takes place. The political elites of Singapore may wax polemics and lyrics about the necessity and power of a Singaporean Armed Forces but nobody can be sure that the boots will fight. The problem with Singapore national service is that it is too long and it is not necessary to be this long. Sweden and Finland have two of the finest peacetime conscript armies their services are no more than 12 months. Conscription should be short, but intense. Thirdly, governments should be more serious about Civil Defence instead of pretending to be serious about national defence. National defence isn't just about the military. Today's wars reach the living space of the majority of the population very quickly. Electricity are routed through exposed and obvious chokepoints. Electricity generation stations are obvious targets (if the Houthis can blow up a third of Saudi Arabia's oil production capacity with 20 drones, imagine the devastation). We can laugh about the Russian VDV now, but it was very impressive that they could land troops into Kiev on day 1. One brigade of parachute infantry can be airdropped within 30 minutes. While gaining air superiority and suppressing air defence for 30 hours is hard, 30 minutes is feasible and after that, you have to reshuffle your own ground troops to deal with this unexpected threats.

TW self-harm The only thing i remember from sex ed back then was that there's a scene in the video where the guy leans over the girl and the camera pans to the standing fan. The next scene they will be at the clinic with the girl finding out about her pregnancy . I am not sure if the people in charge are honestly aware of how much it affects the psyche of young LGBT kids when they're excluded from the syllabus. Positive inclusion of LGBT segment would help to reinforce that there's nothing wrong with them. When my peers were all exploring and learning more about themselves, and some getting into their first ever relationships, I was in my head wondering what was wrong with me and why I was not like other boys. The only place I learned and saw about sex and sexuality was through porn, which is admittedly not a good example. Constantly worried about my identity, and how people around me would react, to the extent that I fell into depression and self harmed. I am definitely happy with who I am today. I feel grateful that I managed to turn out okay. Of course, the problems with being LGBT here in Singapore never ends, with a different set of problems now. I am nearing 30 but it feels like I am just reaching my youth stage, exploring around and being carefree. But sometimes I wonder how different my childhood could've been. We're constantly told that our society is not ready for LGBT rights. But how can sentiments change positively when there's not even opportunities to learn about it in a safe environment. | OFF | UNT | NULL

One of the interactions resulting from not excluding a particular race/gender/etc, might make them re-think whether they should be looking at having those exclusive criteria.
