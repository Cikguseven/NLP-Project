One thing u all forgot to add, the super power traffic jams because everything, and I mean everything will be on the roads. humans, donkeys, bulls, carts, cars, bus, lorries, motors, bicycle, tricycle, rickshaw, everything. and it happens in their main street. in some junctions, no one follow the traffic light rules. You can see everyone chiong into the junction together but surprisingly, they can some how go pass. bring charcoal pills. drink hot water or boiled water. Mineral water, ensure that it is sealed. Fruits better don't take if already peeled. Food over there is good. after I ate the Naan there, those in sinkieland taste like rubbish. but honestly, this is some place that I won't even want to return for a visit."

Click to expand... Your thought is good. In reality, things don't go that way as you would envisage. Warren Buffett wrote the recent annual letter to welcome new group of shareholders, young generation people. The long term shareholders like me are ok with them. No problem as BRK grows gradually with increasing cash and cash equivalent over time. PCP was the last large acquisition and Buffett won't adjust the price to acquire big company (i.e. deploy a lot of cash that is sitting in the bank). BRK missed the opportunity to acquire, according to him at the shareholder meeting in May 2020, because the Fed buying so many stocks last April 2020. Reactions: silentears"

That's the profile of my replacement, from what I heard. Boss was a one-man show for nearly 5 years, and first subordinate lasted all of 12 months and had quit with immediate notice. Only learnt this after having been there a few months. During the interview, HR had told me the predecessor was there for 2 years. Being out of my previous job after about 2 years as well, thought it sounded alright... Oh, and the boss also has a major temper problem. Some aunties came to warn me about it when boss wasn't around. Experienced it myself shortly after passing probation. Anyway, like you said, what's past is past.

So while I have hopes that he will excel in what he choose, I cannot be certain that it will bring in enough money. For example it's very very tough to be professional sportsman here.

A sizable bequest means you didn't have as much fun as you could have had while you were alive, and/or you delayed someone else's enjoyment longer than necessary because you didn't give away as much of your wealth as quickly as you should have. It is especially important to be as*educationally generous as possible precisely when that generosity was most needed. Timing is often absolutely critical.* Reactions: silentears"

That stall all the belongings no longer on the nearest table to their stall. Now they put their belongings on the floor near their stall. Had Hoe Fried Hokkien Mee for Bfast. Was wonder whether to order medium size or small. But the owner suggests small size at $4.80. Since 1st time there to try their Hokkien Mee, so I order the small size one. Surprisingly the amount for small is actually quite big. Luckily never order medium size one. Some more got 3 prawns not those grey prawns. Can tell that the prawns are quite fresh. Hate a lots Hokkien Mee stalls using grey prawns nowadays. As grey prawns are tasteless one. And their chilli quite unique from others. Overall a quite decent Hokkien Mee."

They seem to have everything under control and properly planned out. Since tearfully leaving the Malaysia-project in 1965, Singapore has gone on to develop from a swampy island to perhaps one of the shiniest examples for the world on what can happen with determined leadership, and well-thought through governance. As painful as it is for us Malaysians to admit, our neighbour has surpassed us in so many fields. From technological and educational advancements to monetary policies, and socio-cultural experiments in a plural society, Singapore is arguably leaps and bounds ahead of us. It really upsets me whenever I go to Singapore. Their efficiency and ease of transportation; simplicity of structure for opening and conducting business; the ability to keep the nation free from radical religiosity; the proper pedestrian walkways; the frequency of international musicians and bands who opt to stop on tour there instead of here; the glamour and sheen on their Formula One circuit; the pittance I get when I convert my ringgit to their dollars; and the list goes on. Singapore truly upsets me. And, it should upset you too. That is, if you are not jingoistic and prone to fall for our perpetual propaganda about Malaysia being “truly Asia” and our penchant for saying to ourselves that “…there’s no place like Malaysia”. I get irked in Singapore simply because their people are no different than us. In fact, so many things are manned and run by Malaysians in that country. Our compatriots in Singapore seem to work with so much more purpose and passion. And there is much evidence that the bulk of that nation’s backbone is actually made up of ‘former’ Malaysians. Heck, even the father of their newly minted prime minister-designate is ‘Ipoh-mali’. His father went to Singapore to work in sales for Sime Darby, and perhaps thought it was better if he domiciled there, instead of coming back here. There is no doubt that his son could have never been in contention for prime minister-ship in our country. Things are better in Singapore. With the possible exception being when they appropriate all our food and claim these as their own creations to the world. Aside from that, there is nothing but envy in me about their nation. The food thing is really very annoying, for sure. But, as a nation, they seem to be better equipped to promote what they offer, globally. And kudos to their government, which seems to know how to ‘market’ their hawker fare more effectively on the international stage, than us. So, what went wrong for Malaysia? Now, some people reading this, will, in a nonchalant and blasé way simply tell me that if I don’t like living in Malaysia, I should just leave. Others might get affronted and tell me to move to Singapore. Worse, as a member of a minority community in my country, I have even been told to go back to where I come from, or be grateful for this blessed land. And, herein lies the problem. Speaking up and calling a spade exactly what it is, often provokes extreme patriotic sentiments. People in Malaysia are schooled to sweep things under the carpet, and pretend that everything is hunky-dory. To this mix of apathy, we can add the special privileges and exclusive state-sponsored policies for the majority community in Malaysia. Our leaders set up their leadership legitimacy on a platform of defending these rights. And, in the process, they have bred generations of Malaysians who distrust each other as well as fear losing their rights to other communities. Rather than providing exemplary and inclusive leadership, they divide us and lord over us. Their modus operandi is to continually stoke the flames of communal and religious intolerance. All the while, they have been accommodating and facilitating the rise of fanaticism. And, they do precious little to assuage the racial tensions that are building up. On the other hand, in Singapore, their prime minister-designate in 2021 spoke at a public forum on race and racism, where he acknowledged that in any multi-racial society, it is harder to be a minority than the majority. He went on to explain that the majority community in Singapore understood this. And so, he asked his fellow Singaporeans to do more and take the extra step to make their minority friends, neighbours, and co-workers feel comfortable. He then invited his fellow countrymen and women to treat others in the same way they’d like to be treated, and by their actions, educate their children to do the same. Will a Malaysian leader ever stand-up in public and acknowledge that it is actually harder and more complex to be part of a minority community in our country? Of course, no. Not at least in the near future. And this is our problem. Special interests and privileges; the pandering to the elites; the apologists in our minority community who are only interested in their own personal gain; the rise of religious radicalism; the lack of clarity of leadership; and the non-inclusivity of all races in Malaysia is why we cannot compare and compete with even our tiniest next-door neighbour. Do we just bury our head in the sand and keep saying that Malaysia is an amazing place to live, or do we finally wake-up and stop our country from going on a downward spiral? Malaysia needs to decide, and do it quickly. Reactions: Zelphon , menthol28 , ricohflex and 11 others"

To this mix of apathy, we can add the special privileges and exclusive state-sponsored policies for the majority community in Malaysia. Our leaders set up their leadership legitimacy on a platform of defending these rights. And, in the process, they have bred generations of Malaysians who distrust each other as well as fear losing their rights to other communities. Rather than providing exemplary and inclusive leadership, they divide us and lord over us. Their modus operandi is to continually stoke the flames of communal and religious intolerance. All the while, they have been accommodating and facilitating the rise of fanaticism. And, they do precious little to assuage the racial tensions that are building up. On the other hand, in Singapore, their prime minister-designate in 2021 spoke at a public forum on race and racism, where he acknowledged that in any multi-racial society, it is harder to be a minority than the majority. He went on to explain that the majority community in Singapore understood this. And so, he asked his fellow Singaporeans to do more and take the extra step to make their minority friends, neighbours, and co-workers feel comfortable. He then invited his fellow countrymen and women to treat others in the same way they’d like to be treated, and by their actions, educate their children to do the same. Will a Malaysian leader ever stand-up in public and acknowledge that it is actually harder and more complex to be part of a minority community in our country? Of course, no. Not at least in the near future. And this is our problem. Special interests and privileges; the pandering to the elites; the apologists in our minority community who are only interested in their own personal gain; the rise of religious radicalism; the lack of clarity of leadership; and the non-inclusivity of all races in Malaysia is why we cannot compare and compete with even our tiniest next-door neighbour.

They seem to have everything under control and properly planned out.

That is, if you are not jingoistic and prone to fall for our perpetual propaganda about Malaysia being “truly Asia” and our penchant for saying to ourselves that “…there’s no place like Malaysia”.

2607,/threads/we-cant-even-compete-with-tiny-neighbour-singapore.6740048/,RyanJosie,"58 edwarde2 said: https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2022/04/28/we-cant-even-compete-with-tiny-neighbour-singapore/ The current ruling party in our neighbouring and erstwhile former country-mate, Singapore, announced their pick for their next generation prime minister. They seem to have everything under control and properly planned out. Since tearfully leaving the Malaysia-project in 1965, Singapore has gone on to develop from a swampy island to perhaps one of the shiniest examples for the world on what can happen with determined leadership, and well-thought through governance. As painful as it is for us Malaysians to admit, our neighbour has surpassed us in so many fields. From technological and educational advancements to monetary policies, and socio-cultural experiments in a plural society, Singapore is arguably leaps and bounds ahead of us. It really upsets me whenever I go to Singapore. Their efficiency and ease of transportation; simplicity of structure for opening and conducting business; the ability to keep the nation free from radical religiosity; the proper pedestrian walkways; the frequency of international musicians and bands who opt to stop on tour there instead of here; the glamour and sheen on their Formula One circuit; the pittance I get when I convert my ringgit to their dollars; and the list goes on. Singapore truly upsets me. And, it should upset you too. That is, if you are not jingoistic and prone to fall for our perpetual propaganda about Malaysia being “truly Asia” and our penchant for saying to ourselves that “…there’s no place like Malaysia”. I get irked in Singapore simply because their people are no different than us. In fact, so many things are manned and run by Malaysians in that country. Our compatriots in Singapore seem to work with so much more purpose and passion. And there is much evidence that the bulk of that nation’s backbone is actually made up of ‘former’ Malaysians. Heck, even the father of their newly minted prime minister-designate is ‘Ipoh-mali’. His father went to Singapore to work in sales for Sime Darby, and perhaps thought it was better if he domiciled there, instead of coming back here. There is no doubt that his son could have never been in contention for prime minister-ship in our country. Things are better in Singapore. With the possible exception being when they appropriate all our food and claim these as their own creations to the world. Aside from that, there is nothing but envy in me about their nation. The food thing is really very annoying, for sure. But, as a nation, they seem to be better equipped to promote what they offer, globally. And kudos to their government, which seems to know how to ‘market’ their hawker fare more effectively on the international stage, than us. So, what went wrong for Malaysia? Now, some people reading this, will, in a nonchalant and blasé way simply tell me that if I don’t like living in Malaysia, I should just leave. Others might get affronted and tell me to move to Singapore. Worse, as a member of a minority community in my country, I have even been told to go back to where I come from, or be grateful for this blessed land. And, herein lies the problem. Speaking up and calling a spade exactly what it is, often provokes extreme patriotic sentiments. People in Malaysia are schooled to sweep things under the carpet, and pretend that everything is hunky-dory. To this mix of apathy, we can add the special privileges and exclusive state-sponsored policies for the majority community in Malaysia. Our leaders set up their leadership legitimacy on a platform of defending these rights. And, in the process, they have bred generations of Malaysians who distrust each other as well as fear losing their rights to other communities. Rather than providing exemplary and inclusive leadership, they divide us and lord over us. Their modus operandi is to continually stoke the flames of communal and religious intolerance. All the while, they have been accommodating and facilitating the rise of fanaticism. And, they do precious little to assuage the racial tensions that are building up. On the other hand, in Singapore, their prime minister-designate in 2021 spoke at a public forum on race and racism, where he acknowledged that in any multi-racial society, it is harder to be a minority than the majority. He went on to explain that the majority community in Singapore understood this. And so, he asked his fellow Singaporeans to do more and take the extra step to make their minority friends, neighbours, and co-workers feel comfortable. He then invited his fellow countrymen and women to treat others in the same way they’d like to be treated, and by their actions, educate their children to do the same. Will a Malaysian leader ever stand-up in public and acknowledge that it is actually harder and more complex to be part of a minority community in our country? Of course, no. Not at least in the near future. And this is our problem. Special interests and privileges; the pandering to the elites; the apologists in our minority community who are only interested in their own personal gain; the rise of religious radicalism; the lack of clarity of leadership; and the non-inclusivity of all races in Malaysia is why we cannot compare and compete with even our tiniest next-door neighbour. Do we just bury our head in the sand and keep saying that Malaysia is an amazing place to live, or do we finally wake-up and stop our country from going on a downward spiral? Malaysia needs to decide, and do it quickly. Click to expand... Singaporeans should be glad they can never get their act together."

In 2020, after 55 years, Malaysia's population has grown to 32.37m or 3.4x increase and has a GDP of 337bn or 112x growth in GDP. Singapore meanwhile, had a population of 1.9m in 1965 and is 5.7m in 2020. This is only a 3x growth in population which is lower than Malaysia's population growth. Meanwhile, Singapore had less than 1bn in GDP in 1965 and is now at 340bn in 2020. This is a 340x growth in GDP. In other words, Singapore grew GDP at more than 3 times the pace of Malaysia despite having a slower population growth rate than Malaysia. So your conclusion that Singapore's GDP growth is mainly from population growth is not technically correct."

Prior to Japan's surrender, the British and Malayan Chinese were comrades. Fighting together against the Japanese invaders. After the war, Malaya and Singapore were administered by British. The Communist wing of Malayan Chinese started to assert itself as if to take over Malaya by force of arms. Thus the Malayan Emergency started on 16 Jun 1948 and lasted till 12 Jul 1960. By 1949 Communists in China won the civil war. Communist action in Malaya became more acute. At that time there was also a huge Communist Party in Indonesia. You know how nervous US & UK were about Malaya and Indonesia becoming 1 Communist bloc. The British fought Malayan Communist Party MCP for control of Malaya. The British did enforce concentration camps for Malayan Chinese, euphemistically named ""New Villages"". In the end the British won a bitter fight, which made the British HATE Malayan Chinese Communists or SUSPECT Malayan Chinese generally, (if unsure whether they were Communists). Fast forward to few years before 1957 when Britain was discussing independence for Malaya. Now you know where Britain was coming from and their hatred for  Malayan Chinese Communists. The Constitution of Federation of Malaya was drafted to skew rights and privileges and MILITARY & POLICE POWERS to one race. The Malayan Chinese had no voice in those independence negotiations. Once this toxic seed was planted there was no turning back. You have the Malaysia of today as described by TS. Last edited: 1 minute ago"

Mark Zuckerberg wants to spend big on the metaverse, but investors are skeptical​ The metaverse will cost billions more to build, but Zuckerberg has bigger problems in front of him. Mark Zuckerberg told the world last October that he was all in on the metaverse , and that the endeavor that would only get more expensive over time. Now that his company’s stock price has been hammered in recent months, he is dialing back that rhetoric. Meta will “slow the pace of some of our investments” due to “our current business growth levels,” Zuckerberg said during the company’s first-quarter earnings call Wednesday. Meta’s profits for the first quarter were $7.5 billion, down 21 percent from the year-ago period. Revenue rose 7 percent to $27.9 billion, the slowest growth rate since the company went public a decade ago. Its target expense range for 2022 was lowered by $3 billion. Make no mistake: Zuckerberg is still spending billions a year on building devices and software for the metaverse, a concept he thinks will eventually be as big as the mobile internet. The Reality Labs division of Meta, which makes the Quest VR headset and future AR glasses, has about 17,000 employees and lost almost $3 billion last quarter alone. The problem is that Meta’s investors are uncomfortable right now with that level of spending, especially when the payoff is years away. Sometimes a stock price tells the story. In the case of Meta, its price has plummeted nearly 50 percent, evaporating the last five years of growth , since it rebranded from Facebook last October . That was when Zuckerberg revealed he was already spending $10 billion a year on Reality Labs, and that he expected the investment to grow despite not seeing a return until at least the latter half of this decade. If his core business of ad-driven social media was growing like it was in years past, investors might have responded positively to the Meta pivot. But the timing couldn’t have been worse: Facebook is growing slower than ever, thanks in large part to younger users fleeing the service . TikTok is eating into time spent on both Facebook and Instagram. And Apple’s ad tracking changes have already cost Meta more than $10 billion in lost revenue . Meanwhile, regulators have blocked Zuckerberg’s ability to make big, transformative acquisitions in social media that could jumpstart growth again. Facebook is still growing, but slower than ever. After reporting its first-ever drop in daily users for the fourth quarter of 2021, the blue app managed to grow daily users by just 4 percent to 1.96 billion last quarter, while daily users across Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook ticked up slightly from 2.82 billion to 2.87 billion. With expectations already set low by Wall Street, Meta’s stock price shot up more than 15 percent after it reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the first quarter. “Meta’s ad business continues to face some very real challenges,” said Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. “Facebook, of course, is no stranger to obstacles, but the iOS changes are the first direct threat to its ad business. Combined with the rise of TikTok, brand safety concerns, and a shift in social media user behavior, there’s a perfect storm heading straight for Meta’s ad revenues.” It’s clear that, in the short term, Zuckerberg believes that copying TikTok will revive its growth. He said Wednesday that the company’s short-form video product, Reels, accounted for 20 percent of time spent on Instagram, and that video consumption was already more than half the time spent on Facebook. Meta is early in monetizing Reels with ads, but it is following the same playbook Zuckerberg used to successfully copy Snapchat’s Stories feature.

With expectations already set low by Wall Street, Meta’s stock price shot up more than 15 percent after it reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the first quarter. “Meta’s ad business continues to face some very real challenges,” said Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. “Facebook, of course, is no stranger to obstacles, but the iOS changes are the first direct threat to its ad business. Combined with the rise of TikTok, brand safety concerns, and a shift in social media user behavior, there’s a perfect storm heading straight for Meta’s ad revenues.” It’s clear that, in the short term, Zuckerberg believes that copying TikTok will revive its growth. He said Wednesday that the company’s short-form video product, Reels, accounted for 20 percent of time spent on Instagram, and that video consumption was already more than half the time spent on Facebook. Meta is early in monetizing Reels with ads, but it is following the same playbook Zuckerberg used to successfully copy Snapchat’s Stories feature. Mark Zuckerberg wants to spend big on the metaverse, but investors are skeptical Zuckerberg has bigger problems than spending on the metaverse. www.theverge.com Click to expand...

Not a question of ngiao can afford or cannot. You at HC paying reasonable rental, cannot go increase just as an excuse by more than 20%. I will boycott such stalls.

For me, I don't like vendors taking advantage for no good reason, merely to boost profits. There is also such a thing as where yo eat, if I go to Indian restaurant - good one, I know if say I order mee goreng or more likely briyani I'll have to ay double than at a hawker. And I do patronise such places. But when I go hawker I expect to have reasonable hawker prices and increases according to market rate. If the prata restaurant types can sell at 4.50, that's the market rate. But if a hawker at HC on old rental rates, charges that, that's simply trying to take customers for a ride. It's kust like you take grab, taxi or limo taxi, you expect different prices  according to the type you ordered. It cannot be that normal taxi is also charging limo taxi fares. Yes end of the day it's still a ride from PT A to PT B. But that's not the point. This HC got 2 main indian muslim stalls. Both are okay, food rather nice. But this is my regular. As i said i dont mind if for Hari Raya he raise a bit more than normal, that's ok. CNY we also have to pay a bit more. But if this is his permanent price, then sorry, call me what you want.

Indeed, RIP is one thing, the scarier outcome would be complications from pericarditis: Pericarditis - Symptoms and causes www.mayoclinic.org Early diagnosis and treatment of pericarditis usually reduces the risk of complications. Potential complications of pericarditis include: Fluid buildup around the heart (pericardial effusion). The fluid buildup can lead to further heart complications. Thickening and scarring of the heart lining (constrictive pericarditis). Some people with long-term pericarditis develop permanent thickening and scarring of the pericardium. The changes prevent the heart from filling and emptying properly. This unusual complication often leads to severe swelling of the legs and abdomen and shortness of breath. Pressure on the heart due to fluid buildup (cardiac tamponade). This life-threatening condition prevents the heart from filling properly. Less blood leaves the heart, causing a dramatic drop in blood pressure. Cardiac tamponade requires emergency treatment. Reactions: henghengonedragon , Geneco and tmster"

When a medical practitioner feels that the patient is disregarding professional advice at the expense of his or her own well-being (where health risks are significant given the circumstances), the patient would be requested to sign it as acknowledgement. This to safeguard the practitioner as well as drive home to the patient the severity of the risk). The patient ultimately has the right of choice on whether to heed the given advice or not. As for the body being able to heal itself given enough time - this statement is moot. The human body is far from perfect. There are many situations in which supposedly sound mechanisms can go into self-destruction mode e.g. heart failure arising from inflammation of the heart lining or tissue causing arrhythmia.

It may be true that there are admin, operational and logistical and various other related costs of carrying out a death penalty. The sentencing and the sentence itself are part of the judiciary process. To suggest that because it costs money, perhaps we should consider abolishing the death penalty is to say that we retrench the judges, the police officers guarding the courtroom, the court clerk and the entire support staff for even having a State Court and High Court...because they cost money.

Why SG is not fielding any players for doubles and mixed doubles? just thinking lky can partner yeo jiamin to compete in mixed doubles Click to expand... In badminton, playing doubles is a different ball game from playing singles. Things you should do or strategy you adopt in playing singles are most of the time bad for doubles play and vice versa. (This is also why badminton rackets very good for playing Singles are usually not very good for playing doubles.) A player good in playing singles is usually not very good in playing doubles and vice versa.  Once it reaches a high level, the more a player trains for doubles, the worse he/she will get in playing singles and vice versa. In addition, there must be a good understanding between the partners for doubles in what each of them should do, move, position themselves and who should receive/hit the shuttlecock under various situations during a rally. Therefore, a doubles pair consisting of world top male singles + world top female singles will still probably lose to any of the world's top 20 mixed doubles pair.

If LKY continues to play like he did so far. However, LKY's offensive is something i dont think Kidambi has seen so far in WC. Am very certain the Indian side will be analyzing and preparing for it. As it is, uncertain if Kidambi can take LKY's offensive. Only VA has proven capable of doing so in this WC. I think a straight-set is still possible.  It is a game of mental resilience for LKY.

From the way he's playing at the moment, he's very fit, very fast in his movement around the court, much more matured as a player as compared to 2 yrs ago, more confident and most importantly, he seems to be enjoying himself. If he can beat all the seeded players in a top tournament in straight sets as well as have the crowd behind him then there's absolutely no reason why he cannot win the tournament.  The crowd was rooting for him in the SF, chanting ""Loh Kean"", ""Loh Kean"", probably because he was unseeded and the underdog who exceeded everyone's expectation. I believe his confident was boosted when he defeated Prannoy, a player who had beaten him 2 out of 2 and one who had beaten five world #1 players from different countries in different tournaments. If my memory serves me well, no unseeded player has ever reach the finals of a major badminton tournament.  So this, in itself, is already an astonishing achievement.

There is a similar ranking system where you earn points. Tournaments sanctioned by SBA and open to foreigners (pre covid) award more points. Seeding depends on how many ranking points you have. most of the academies here the head coach are either from China, Malaysia or Indonesia. A few are run by ex Singapore national players. Group training costs $30-40 for 2 hours and private training $100-150 for 2 hours. Reactions: tiger2013"

Up to Pri 4 level we still can compete with the top juniors in the region. The gap starts to widen from P5 and secondary onwards, when there is a need to balance academic priorities. We simply cannot put in as many training hours unlike others that live and breathe badminton. Another issue is teenage distractions. Even those in sports school will lag behind peers. By the time they reach 16 years old, if we are lucky we may still have 1 outstanding junior per batch, sometimes none. Unlike other powerhouses like China, Japan, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia that are spoilt for choices, just look at the numbers they send for the Asia U15 and U17 championships. We can then only try to remain competitive through superior coaching, fitness and sports psychology. Plus hope that the junior stays motivated and injury-free. Last edited: Dec 19, 2021"

No what I'm trying to say is, Our kids lack that kind of gungho fall-down-get-up-dust-yourself Kind of attitude that go beyond pri 4 into adulthood.

The Chinese government in Beijing, established after the Chinese Civil War in 1949, has never governed Taiwan , whose president, Tsai Ing-wen, describes the island democracy as a ""functionally independent"" country, albeit one with limited recognition by a handful of U.N. member states. China's ambition to annex the island is stifled only by Taiwanese will to resist and continued security assistance from the United States, which has remained Taiwan's strongest international backer for decades despite switching formal diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. Secretary of State Antony Blinken attends a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on April 26, 2022. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin protested Blinkenâ€™s remarks in an April 27 press conference after senior American diplomat said the U.S. would ensure Taiwan had â€œall necessary meanâ€ to defend itself against aggression by China.AL DRAGO/POOL/GETTY IMAGES During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Tuesday, lawmakers pressed Secretary of State Antony Blinken for assurances that the administration of President Joe Biden would help sustain this long-standing ""status quo"" across the Taiwan Strait, primarily through the transfer of arms and training . ""We are determined to make sure that [Taiwan] has all the necessary means to defend itself against any potential aggression, including unilateral action by China to disrupt the status quo that's been in place now for many decades,"" Blinken said. On Wednesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, voiced opposition to Blinken's comments. He suggested they were inconsistent with the U.S.'s ""one China"" policy, which recognizes the legitimacy of Beijing's governance over mainland China, but only acknowledges its claim to Taiwan. Officially, the U.S. considers the status of Taiwan, a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945, to be undetermined under international law. As such, it takes no position on sovereignty over the island. In 2021, after a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping , Biden appeared to endorse Taiwanese self-determination, saying: ""Let them make up their mind."" ""Since Taiwan is a part of China, how can the mainland 'invade' Taiwan?"" Wang said, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks. Incidentally, Beijing hasn't publicly called Russia 's war against Ukraine an "" invasion "" either. An English version on the Foreign Ministry's website included an additional line not said by the official: ""The U.S. admits that Taiwan is part of China, but keeps talking about the mainland's potential 'aggression' of Taiwan. Isn't this self-contradictory since a country cannot 'invade' part of its own territory?"" Despite what appears to be a clear disagreement between Beijing and Washington in interpreting the status quo, Wang accused the U.S. of ""reneging"" on its commitments. It would push Taiwan into ""dangerous waters"" and lead to ""unbearable cost"" for America, too, he said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin attends a regular press briefing in Beijing on November 9, 2020. Wang suggested at a press conference on April 27, 2022, that China would reject attempts to classify a future attack on Taiwan as an â€œinvasion,â€ as it considers the island part of its territory.GREG BAKER/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES The U.S. has stepped up efforts to help Taiwan bolster its self-defense, but it hasn't publicly committed to come to its defense in the event of a Chinese attack. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, successive American administrations have supplied Taiwan with defensive weapons, but all have stopped short of an ironclad guarantee of direct military support—a deliberate policy of "" strategic ambiguity "" that keeps both sides guessing. Taiwan's fate has been the subject of renewed attention in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine . While Taiwanese officials don't believe an attack is imminent, they do see an alarming buildup of Chinese capabilities, and are trying to instill a sense of urgency in Taiwan's public. When asked the perennial question about a hypothetical response to a future move on the island, senior U.S. officials have instead pointed to the need to increase deterrence in the Taiwan Strait by raising awareness among America's key allies. ""Certainly, we have expressed our concerns about China taking efforts to unilaterally change the status quo, and we think they are carefully looking at what's happening in Ukraine to learn lessons writ large, including with respect to Taiwan,"" Jake Sullivan , the president's national security adviser, told The Economic Club earlier this month. He continued: ""Now for the U.S. ourselves, the situation with Ukraine and the situation with Taiwan are not the same. Our relationship with Taiwan is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act; our security partnership is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act. ""One of the things that we have focused on in the past several weeks is actually deep consultations with allies and partners, including in Europe, to say: 'This kind of thing can happen in Europe; this kind of thing can also happen in the Indo-Pacific.' ""It's incumbent upon responsible countries in the world to send a clear message that any type of aggression is unacceptable wherever it happens."" Asked whether that meant an explicit U.S. aim to defend Taiwan against an invasion, Sullivan concluded: ""Our official government policy is that we're going to take every step we possibly can to ensure that never happens.""

The Chinese government in Beijing, established after the Chinese Civil War in 1949, has never governed Taiwan , whose president, Tsai Ing-wen, describes the island democracy as a ""functionally independent"" country, albeit one with limited recognition by a handful of U.N. member states. China's ambition to annex the island is stifled only by Taiwanese will to resist and continued security assistance from the United States, which has remained Taiwan's strongest international backer for decades despite switching formal diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. Secretary of State Antony Blinken attends a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on April 26, 2022. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin protested Blinkenâ€™s remarks in an April 27 press conference after senior American diplomat said the U.S. would ensure Taiwan had â€œall necessary meanâ€ to defend itself against aggression by China.AL DRAGO/POOL/GETTY IMAGES During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Tuesday, lawmakers pressed Secretary of State Antony Blinken for assurances that the administration of President Joe Biden would help sustain this long-standing ""status quo"" across the Taiwan Strait, primarily through the transfer of arms and training . ""We are determined to make sure that [Taiwan] has all the necessary means to defend itself against any potential aggression, including unilateral action by China to disrupt the status quo that's been in place now for many decades,"" Blinken said. On Wednesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, voiced opposition to Blinken's comments. He suggested they were inconsistent with the U.S.'s ""one China"" policy, which recognizes the legitimacy of Beijing's governance over mainland China, but only acknowledges its claim to Taiwan. Officially, the U.S. considers the status of Taiwan, a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945, to be undetermined under international law. As such, it takes no position on sovereignty over the island. In 2021, after a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping , Biden appeared to endorse Taiwanese self-determination, saying: ""Let them make up their mind."" ""Since Taiwan is a part of China, how can the mainland 'invade' Taiwan?"" Wang said, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks. Incidentally, Beijing hasn't publicly called Russia 's war against Ukraine an "" invasion "" either. An English version on the Foreign Ministry's website included an additional line not said by the official: ""The U.S. admits that Taiwan is part of China, but keeps talking about the mainland's potential 'aggression' of Taiwan. Isn't this self-contradictory since a country cannot 'invade' part of its own territory?"" Despite what appears to be a clear disagreement between Beijing and Washington in interpreting the status quo, Wang accused the U.S. of ""reneging"" on its commitments. It would push Taiwan into ""dangerous waters"" and lead to ""unbearable cost"" for America, too, he said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin attends a regular press briefing in Beijing on November 9, 2020. Wang suggested at a press conference on April 27, 2022, that China would reject attempts to classify a future attack on Taiwan as an â€œinvasion,â€ as it considers the island part of its territory.GREG BAKER/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES The U.S. has stepped up efforts to help Taiwan bolster its self-defense, but it hasn't publicly committed to come to its defense in the event of a Chinese attack. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, successive American administrations have supplied Taiwan with defensive weapons, but all have stopped short of an ironclad guarantee of direct military support—a deliberate policy of "" strategic ambiguity "" that keeps both sides guessing. Taiwan's fate has been the subject of renewed attention in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine . While Taiwanese officials don't believe an attack is imminent, they do see an alarming buildup of Chinese capabilities, and are trying to instill a sense of urgency in Taiwan's public. When asked the perennial question about a hypothetical response to a future move on the island, senior U.S. officials have instead pointed to the need to increase deterrence in the Taiwan Strait by raising awareness among America's key allies. ""Certainly, we have expressed our concerns about China taking efforts to unilaterally change the status quo, and we think they are carefully looking at what's happening in Ukraine to learn lessons writ large, including with respect to Taiwan,"" Jake Sullivan , the president's national security adviser, told The Economic Club earlier this month. He continued: ""Now for the U.S. ourselves, the situation with Ukraine and the situation with Taiwan are not the same. Our relationship with Taiwan is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act; our security partnership is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act. ""One of the things that we have focused on in the past several weeks is actually deep consultations with allies and partners, including in Europe, to say: 'This kind of thing can happen in Europe; this kind of thing can also happen in the Indo-Pacific.' ""It's incumbent upon responsible countries in the world to send a clear message that any type of aggression is unacceptable wherever it happens."" Asked whether that meant an explicit U.S. aim to defend Taiwan against an invasion, Sullivan concluded: ""Our official government policy is that we're going to take every step we possibly can to ensure that never happens."" The State Department and Taiwan's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to Newsweek 's request for comment before publication. Click to expand... Call police catch thieves operation?"

With tombs dedicated to 'orang bunian' – a sort of supernatural human-like being – it's easy to see why these stories persist. Kubur Kassim is one of the oldest burial grounds in Singapore and was established way back in the 1920s on a piece of land in Siglap owned by a Muslim entrepreneur. https://remembersingapore.org/2019/09/01/singapore-past-present-cemeteries-part-2/ The Siglap and Bedok areas have a number of old and former Muslim graveyards. The maps of the fifties show that there were plots of Muslim cemeteries, often named as Mohammedan cemeteries, in the vicinity. One of them is the Kubur Kassim Cemetery, established in the 1920s on a piece of land along Siglap Road endowed by Ahna Mohamed Kassim bin Ally Mohamed, a cargo boat and steam launch owner. Kubur Kassim Cemetery’s striking yellow and green gates possess the Indo-Saracenic style of a mixture of Mughal and classical European features, a popular architectural design in Malaya in the early 20th century. The cemetery, which also houses a surau (prayer house in Malay), used to serve as the final resting place for the Muslims living in Siglap. Buried at Kubur Kassim Cemetery were some of the well-known community leaders, including former Singapore Municipal Commissioner Dr Hafeezudin Sirajuddin Moonshi, who became the first in Singapore to open a Muslim clinic in 1916. Another was Che Lembek binte Abdin, the former headmistress of Kampong Glam Girls’ School during the Second World War. For years, Kubur Kassim Cemetery has been a source of haunted tales. This may be due to the fact that some of its tombs are dedicated to Orang Bunian, a kind of supernatural human-like beings often portrayed in Malay folklore. However, the 90-year-old cemetery may be facing the likelihood of exhumation. In the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s (URA) 2014 master plan, the site where the cemetery resides has been earmarked for future residential development. About 200m away from Siglap Road, at Jalan Sempadan, was the grave of a Sumatran prince called Tok Lasam (or Lassam), believed to be the founder and penghulu (chieftain in Malay) of Siglap. Marked by yellow tombs, signifying royalty, the grave also included Tok Lassam’s wife and his panglima (commander-in-chief). It was said that Tok Lasam came to Singapore and established a fishing village by the sea in the early 19th century. In 1821, a solar eclipse occurred, frightening many of the village’s residents who thought their village had fell into the darkness. This led to the naming of the village as si-gelap , meaning “dark one” in Malay."

There are no clear demarcations between our reality and the Orang Bunian's reality and you can't see their world with the naked eye. To enter their world, you must have the special ability to do so. ""Mediums or bomohs can ""befriend"" them. They are not spirits that you can manipulate or instruct like the Toyol or Jinn. ""There is a way of speaking to them. You can speak nicely to them by asking them to fulfil your requests, but if that does not work, at times you can also threaten them or make an offering or barter to come to an agreement."" Many believers of the Malay and Indonesian folklore say that the Orang Bunian is linked to the Minangkabau culture, originating from West Sumatra in Indonesia. The Orang Bunian is known to live in the forest or at foothills and sometimes near cemeteries and empty buildings. Some equate this community to elves while others believe they are built on a royal social structure, with kings, queens and princesses' in tow. These spirits are known to appear during sunset. The Orang Bunian are often used as a reason to explain cases of missing children or when people go astray in forests. From Wikipedia, In Malaysian, Bruneian and Indonesian folklore, Bunian people or Orang bunian (Indonesian pronunciation: [o.raŋ bu.ni.an]) are supernatural beings said to be invisible to most humans, except those with ""spiritual sight"". While the term is often translated as ""elves"", it literally translates to ""hidden people"" or ""whistling people"". Orang bunian are described as beautiful, dressed in ancient Southeast Asian style, and nearly identical to humans in appearance. Some mythological accounts describe the lack of a philtrum. Modern depictions of Orang bunian deviate from the traditional folklore by including elf-like features, pointed ears, high fantasy-influenced attire, or modern Minangkabau long coat clothing.[1] Orang bunian are said to inhabit the deep forests or high mountains in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra & Borneo, far from human contact,[2] as well as near human communities, and are even said to share the same houses as human families.[3] According to legend, their social structure is similar to that of humans in the ancient Malay Peninsula, with families, clans, and royalty. As with other mythical beings in Indonesian folklore, Orang bunian often have supernatural powers,[4] and must be appeased with certain rituals and customs before humans are allowed to trespass areas which they inhabit. Orang bunian are generally regarded as benevolent, befriending and assisting humans, particularly magicians (dukun or bomoh) and shamans (pawang).[5] They are said to be able to intermarry with humans and bear invisible children.[6] According to some tales, men had married Orang bunian women but later decided to leave the bunian community and return to the families they had left behind. However, after returning to human society, they found that many years had passed and everyone they once knew had died. These narratives have been compared to Urashima Taro and Rip Van Winkle.[7]"

According to the USA Centers for Disease Control , “Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine."" In addition, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Decades of studying mRNA have shown no long-term side-effects. According to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia , the vaccine is not expected to have long-term negative effects for a few reasons: First, most negative effects occur within 6 weeks of receiving a vaccine, which is why the FDA asked the companies to provide 8 weeks of safety data after the last dose. Second, the mRNA in the vaccine breaks down pretty quickly because our cells need a way to stop mRNA from making too many proteins or too much protein. But, even if for some reason our cells did not break down the vaccine mRNA, the mRNA stops making the protein within about a week, regardless of the body’s immune response to the protein."

Click to expand... just expand the text below & u'll see this (chiu can shake yr head while listening, it absorbs better) This video lecture of BiologyExplained talks in details about the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm vaccine. Who approved Sinopharm vaccine on 7Th May 2021. Sinopharm vaccine works on on classical vaccine making platform: inactivated  vaccine like out Indian vaccine Covaxin, Sinopharm vaccine is found to have an efficacy of 78.1% according to the phase 3 trial data. However, there are certain drawbacks about the study. The study included mostly male and most of them were below the age of 60. And none of them had any underlying health issues. However, we know that the most vulnerable people hit by Covid 19 are the elderly and people with comorbidities. So, excluding them from the trail data might have some effect on the real world. One study from Hungary showed 25% of the people who were above 60 years of age did not have any neutralizing antibody and 50% of the people above 80 years of age did not have any neutralizing antibody. This is a matter of concern as they are the most vulnerable group for coronavirus infection. In another study from Srilanka found that natural infection and Sinopharm vaccine imparts same protection against delta variant. And the amount of neutralizing antibody was 1.38-fold less in case of delta variant, while it was 10-fold reduced in case of beta variant. So, it seems Sinopharm imparts more protection against Delta variant."

5660,/threads/sinovac-sinopharm-group.6531879/,Tsoukalos,"65 https://www.todayonline.com/singapo...staff-keep-workplace-free-covid-19-tripartite A guideline for employers on how to keep their workplaces safe from Covid-19 has been released by the MOM, MOH, NTUC and SNEF The advisory urges employers to adopt a “vaccinate or regular test” for their staff as a means to keep the workplace free from Covid-19 Under the guidelines, it said that unvaccinated employees should bear any costs that only affect them But “under no circumstances” should an employer terminate or threaten to terminate the service of an employee on the basis of vaccination status alone SINGAPORE — All employers are urged to adopt a regime that either sees their staff fully vaccinated against Covid-19, or requires unvaccinated staff to undergo regular testing to keep their workplaces free from the coronavirus, said an advisory from Singapore’s tripartite partners on Monday (Aug 23). The advisory added that in such scenarios, some Covid-19 related costs, such as test kits, incurred by unvaccinated employees, who are eligible for vaccination, should be borne by them. However, it said that “under no circumstances” should an employer terminate or threaten to terminate the service of an employee on the basis of vaccination status alone. Employers should also not place employees on no-pay leave for an extended duration without their mutual consent in writing. Still, the advisory said employers may exercise their right to contractually terminate employment if unvaccinated employees do not comply with reasonable vaccination-differentiated workplace measures. READ ALSO Up to 50% of staff may return to workplaces from Aug 19 as Covid-19 rules ease further The advisory was issued by the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Health (MOH), National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation. Although the proportion of Singaporeans that has been fully vaccinated stood at 78 per cent, as of Sunday, the tripartite group noted that Singapore needs to ""continue to expand our vaccine coverage to optimise our resilience against Covid-19"". To that end, the Government has announced that from Oct 1, employees in selected sectors that include healthcare, food and beverage and fitness studios, will be required to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing. Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Health and Manpower, said in a Facebook post related to the advisory that ""the public service, as the largest employer in Singapore, is leading by example by implementing the VoRT (vaccinate or regular test) regime"". ""The tripartite partners urge all employers to consider adopting the VoRT regime as a company policy for existing employees and new hires,"" he said. The advisory said employers may adopt differentiation measures, in consultation with unions if applicable, between vaccinated and unvaccinated staff. Here is a summary of the guidelines. TESTING FREQUENCY The guidelines said employers may adopt a VoRT regime on a voluntary basis and subject unvaccinated employees to additional Covid-19 tests, compared to vaccinated employees. The latest statement said the frequency of testing unvaccinated staff could take reference from the frequency under MOH’s guidelines for the regime. For example, it could be twice a week for unvaccinated employees in selected sectors. A test done under the existing “fast and easy testing” or the “rostered routine testing” regime also counts towards this requirement. WORK AND SOCIAL EVENTS Employers may also require unvaccinated employees to undergo pre-event testing before participating in workplace events, said the guidelines, or implement reduced group sizes when unvaccinated employees participate in such events. This is especially so for those involving mask-off activities, in line with the prevailing MOH guidelines. STAFF DEPLOYMENT While unvaccinated staff can be continued to be deployed in higher risk activities with regular testing, the advisory said employers can also decide whether to redeploy them to another job with a lower risk of Covid-19 infection. Such a decision should be commensurate with the employee’s experience and skills, as per existing redeployment policies. “If there are no existing redeployment policies within the organisation, the terms and conditions for redeployment should be mutually agreed between employers and employees,” said the advisory. OTHER MEASURES The advisory added that employers can also implement other workplace measures, though they must be “prepared to justify to employees and/or the Government” that they are reasonable and necessary for business operations and to better protect the health and safety of all employees. It added that the union and the employer may mutually agree on other vaccination-differentiated workplace measures. COSTS The advisory noted that “some costs are necessary and common” for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. In such cases, it said those costs should be borne by the employer. In cases where costs are required only for unvaccinated employees, the advisory said employers can require medically eligible but unvaccinated employees to bear such additional costs as follows: Covid-19 related expenses: These include the costs of test kits and stay-home notice accommodation, which can be recovered either through salary deductions or requiring employees pay the service provider directly Leave: The advisory noted that unvaccinated employees may be discharged later from treatment, or may be served with a longer stay-home notice compared to vaccinated employees. In such situations, it said employers can deduct these days from an individual’s existing leave entitlement Medical benefits: The advisory said employers may choose to exclude these employees from medical benefits associated with Covid-19 The advisory said these points do not include employees who are medically ineligible for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. PREPARING THE WORKPLACE The advisory said that employers which adopt the VoRT regime as a company policy should communicate “clearly and in advance to affected employees and jobseekers” about the vaccination-differentiated workplace measures and any associated costs that employees may have to bear. MONITORING OF EMPLOYEES For the purposes of business continuity, the advisory said employers may ask employees for their vaccination status. Furthermore, it said that employers that adopt the VoRT regime can also require employees to produce proof of vaccination. Employees who refuse to do so would be treated as unvaccinated for the purposes of the vaccination-differentiated measures, and they will have to bear the relevant costs. The advisory also said employers should urge all their medically eligible employees who have yet to be vaccinated to do so, and implement public education programmes on vaccine safety and efficacy for their employees. It said employers should facilitate vaccination by granting paid time-off to employees for Covid-19 vaccination, and additional paid sick leave that is beyond contractual or statutory requirement, in the “rare event” that the employee experiences a vaccine-related adverse event.

Only those medically unsuitable should choose alternatives. Otherwise you should Always choose the superior one. Just look at the Singapore ICU and death rates vs those that use sinovac as the dominantly vaccine like indonesia, thailand and Malaysia. We are now vaccinated, study this group of statistics not infection rates,  vacines don't prevent infection,  they reduce death tolls and ICU rates. I took pfizer and so did my friends, family and colleagues including those from PRC,  those with underlying illness and above 70. None of us died, no one got positive with any covid test. We took the jab not because it is free, but because we don't want to die and we don't want to become a burden to others by becoming heavier virus carriers. Who goes for sinovac in Singapore? 1. Those who are certified medically unsuitable for mRNA. 2. Those who politicize vaccines 3. Charlatans 4. Muppets who think they know more about something they never studied before 5. People who suffered brain damage without realising it decided to use their lives and other people lives to prove a point.

5850,/threads/sinovac-sinopharm-group.6531879/,billovee,"55 jericho75 said: what is anaphylaxis? Click to expand... Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to, such as peanuts or bee stings. Anaphylaxis causes your immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock — your blood pressure drops suddenly and your airways narrow, blocking breathing. Signs and symptoms include a rapid, weak pulse; a skin rash; and nausea and vomiting. Common triggers include certain foods, some medications, insect venom and latex. Anaphylaxis requires an injection of epinephrine and a follow-up trip to an emergency room. If you don't have epinephrine, you need to go to an emergency room immediately. If anaphylaxis isn't treated right away, it can be fatal. if within 15 to 30 mins not cure, the person ko. Risk factors There aren't many known risk factors for anaphylaxis, but some things that might increase your risk include: Previous anaphylaxis. If you've had anaphylaxis once, your risk of having this serious reaction increases. Future reactions might be more severe than the first reaction. Allergies or asthma. People who have either condition are at increased risk of having anaphylaxis. Certain other conditions. These include heart disease and an abnormal accumulation of a certain type of white blood cell (mastocytosis). Complications An anaphylactic reaction can be life-threatening — it can stop your breathing or your heartbeat."

For all Work Permit, S Pass (SP), Employment Pass (EP), Dependant’s Pass holders & others who reside in dormitories We will schedule your workers for vaccination at the designated MOM vaccination centres. Your worker will receive both doses of the vaccination if they have not been infected by COVID-19. If your worker has been infected by COVID-19 and has recovered for over 3 months, we will schedule your worker to go for a single dose of the vaccination. For Work Permit holders in the Construction, Marine shipyard and Process sectors and not residing in dormitories We will coordinate with Sector Leads (Building and Construction Authority (BCA) – Construction; Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) – Marine shipyard; Economic Development Board (EDB) – Process) to schedule your worker for vaccination. For SP, EP, DP holders and others in the Construction, Marine shipyard and Process sectors and not residing in dormitories For Work Permit, SP, EP, DP holders & others who are not in the Construction, Marine shipyard and Process sectors and not residing in dormitories For Migrant Domestic Workers You can register for COVID-19 Vaccination online and you will receive an SMS as soon as there are vacant slots available for booking. FAQs on COVID-19 vaccination for work pass holders Employers can find out how to get COVID-19 vaccination for their Work Permit (including MDWs), S Pass, EP, LTVP and Dependant’s Pass holders who are in Singapore. www.mom.gov.sg While the COVID-19 vaccination is voluntary , we need your help to strongly encourage all your eligible workers to get the vaccination and protect themselves against COVID-19. You should arrange transportation to and from the vaccination centre if your workers who wish to be vaccinated. As with all medications and established vaccines, there is a small risk of very rare and serious adverse events that may occur after vaccination. However, MOH has Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) to support people who suffer serious adverse events that are assessed to be likely related to COVID-19 vaccines administered in Singapore. This includes Work Permit (including FDWs), S Pass, EP, LTVP and Dependant’s Pass holders. Vaccination will be provided free to all Work Permit (including FDWs), S Pass, EP, LTVP and Dependant’s Pass holders. S’pore employers may ask staff who choose not to be vaccinated to pay for regular Covid-19 testing Employers may also exclude such staff from medical benefits linked to Covid-19. . Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com Employers should not terminate or threaten to terminate the service of an employee on the basis of vaccination status alone. But they can terminate an unvaccinated employee who does not comply with reasonable vaccination-differentiated workplace measures. They added that employers can require medically eligible workers who are not vaccinated to bear additional costs under the regime. For example, employers may recover from these employees Covid-19-related expenses , such as the cost of test kits and stay-home notice accommodations, that are incurred over and above those of vaccinated employees. In terms of leave, they said that unvaccinated employees may be discharged later from treatment, or may be served with longer periods of movement restrictions compared with vaccinated employees. Thus, in such situations, employers can deduct the additional days served by a medically eligible but unvaccinated employee from the person’s leave entitlements. “If leave entitlements have been exhausted, employers may require such an employee to go on no-pay leave ,” said the tripartite partners.

It can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to, such as peanuts or bee stings. Anaphylaxis causes your immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock — your blood pressure drops suddenly and your airways narrow, blocking breathing. Signs and symptoms include a rapid, weak pulse; a skin rash; and nausea and vomiting. Common triggers include certain foods, some medications, insect venom and latex. Anaphylaxis requires an injection of epinephrine and a follow-up trip to an emergency room. If you don't have epinephrine, you need to go to an emergency room immediately. If anaphylaxis isn't treated right away, it can be fatal. if within 15 to 30 mins not cure, the person ko. Risk factors There aren't many known risk factors for anaphylaxis, but some things that might increase your risk include: Previous anaphylaxis. If you've had anaphylaxis once, your risk of having this serious reaction increases. Future reactions might be more severe than the first reaction. Allergies or asthma. People who have either condition are at increased risk of having anaphylaxis. Certain other conditions. These include heart disease and an abnormal accumulation of a certain type of white blood cell (mastocytosis). Complications An anaphylactic reaction can be life-threatening — it can stop your breathing or your heartbeat. Click to expand... I summarise for you - A fine line between life and death"

It is worth nothing that Malaysians who received the Sinovac vaccine were jabbed earlier than those who received Pfizer, which is more recent. This means 4 things: 1) Antibody count is higher in Pfizer recipients at this point in time due to both dosage difference (Pfizer 30ug x2 vs Sinovac 3ug x2) and time lapse. 2) Malaysians fully jabbed with Sinovac have more time to potentially be exposed to Covid19 post jab vs Pfizer's. 3) Many of the early jabbers were either more vulnerable to begin with or are working in sectors highly exposed to Covid19 in close proximity. 4) Many who have health issues also chose to jab Sinovac due to lesser side effects (which we know can be fatal)."

For a small percentage, the immune response from vaccine turn on it's own body just like covid infection. Anecdotally, the immune response from vaccine is a lot less severe than the real covid.

At least now we can now still choose. Looking at the global situation, seems like the large pharma is getting the setup ready for gahmens to implement mandatory vaccination. If that day comes, and if the non-mRNA runs out of stock here due to batch orders (like what we have experienced recently), the unvaccinated may have no choice but to take mRNA by default. Then their right to choose will be gone. Last edited: Sep 25, 2021"

Seems like their strategy is first to let those willing to take the vaccines or their own accord. Then impose onerous measures to persuade the remainder to vaccinate. Later, ""force your hand"" by opening up to endemic living. By then, only the hardcore unvaxxed remaining will be a tiny fraction of the initial population. When the mandatory law is imposed that affects such a small group (excluding those with valid medical reasons), the resultant costs that arise for this group should be way smaller and manageable from the gahmen's perspective."

I feel it is unlikely, since the % gain (2% currently) would be quite small compared to the political capital expended to reach that goal. If they do, they would need to show really good scientific evidence to back up their claim, or risk angering the glass-hearts in Mainland China. Also, it would not apply to those whose body have developed allergic reaction to 1st dose of mRNA vaccine. The main benefit of mRNA over non-mRNA is the claimed protection from infection. In that metric, mRNA is clearly superior. This type of vaccine is great if the country is aiming for zero or low infection numbers, like China, HK or even Sg several months ago. But Sg has now chosen the endemic path and head towards herd immunity. Sooner or later, with so many infected cases around and given enough time, most vaccinated people here will become infected with the virus anyway. It is scary but that is the reality. In this situation, the superior protection from infection offered by mRNA vaccines becomes much less relevant for the individual. 上得山多，终遇虎。 In terms of prevention of death and severe symptoms, both mRNA and non-mRNA vaccines are about the same and do very well. This factor is most relevant for those deciding which class of vaccine to take given our nation's endemic stance. Since non-mRNA is good enough for our situation now, the authorities will be hard pressed to convince us to overlook mRNA's current known side effects and bear the risk of developing unknown health problems in future.

There was this family of four who came after me and it was a couple in their 80s or 90s and their son and daughter-in-law in their 50s or 60s. Throughout their wait for the jab, the old couple were grumpy, complaining away and demanding while the son tried his very best to pacify them. He was at his wit's end dealing with his unwilling and demanding parents. The daughter-in-law was visibly stressed and upset and was understandly speaking to the old couple rather tersely. The atmosphere around them was very tense. After the old couple took their jab, they had to wait outside the clinic and were seated near me. Meanwhile, the daughter-in-law took the initiative to go to a provision shop and bought 2 packets of coconut water for her hubby's parents. Although she was still upset with them, she presented the drinks to her in-laws. When I witnessed that act, I felt great love, vicariously. I'm not sure if the old couple realised it, but her initiative to do what little she could to help them cope with their vaccination experience really moved me. She didnt have to, but she did anyway. It's these little moments in life that make me have faith in humankind. Last edited: Sep 27, 2021 Reactions: munimal"
