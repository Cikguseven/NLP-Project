Also the impartiality of the law. how many NUS peeping toms and sex offenders have been spared jail terms because "" they have a good future"" , thus are More deserving of ""second chances"" than their less fortunate counterparts? Didn't this just happen to the 6 lawyers to be ? they were given 2nd chances because oh, the judge didn't want to break young backs, even had their names redacted to protect them further! And what happens to other young backs? ( be they drug traffickers, sex offenders or peeping toms from the lower strata of society (SES)) , they are given HEFTY sentences, and they break the NECKS of the drug trafficker. Their names are also conveniently splashed all over the tabloids. So where is the Fairness and Impartiality of the law? If one wants to give second chances, it should be to give second chances to society generally, not to a select few. Last edited: 10 minutes ago"

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - Long queue of close to 80 people were seen at the Plaza Singapura outlet of Japanese retail chain Daiso on Thursday (April 28) ahead of the price hike from Sunday (May 1). The chain has been offering products such as stationery, snacks and homeware at a flat price of $2 since 2003. FromSunday, prices will follow a colour-coded tier ranging from $2.14 to $25.47. Housewife Sheila Begum, 35, heard of the price hike online and decided do some shopping. ""I wanted to avoid the weekend crowd, but seems like a lot of other people had the same idea,"" the mother of two said. She frequents the Japanese chain a few times a month as she loves collecting trinkets. She said: ""I will continue to shop here of course, but I wanted to stretch my dollar while I still can."" Queue at the Plaza Singapura outletwasat its peak when The Straits Times visited during lunch time. It extended past the cashier area and spilled over to shopping aisles around the store, making it hard for shoppers to move around. Preschool teacher Chua Xinyi, 26, said that she goes to Daiso to buyteaching materials such as mini whiteboards, chalk, and coloured markers. ""I think it's understandable that they had to hike their pricesbecause they are increasing almost everywhere. I'd rather they adjust their prices than close their shops,"" she said. Although she knew the price hike for some products would be just 14 cents, she wasn't sure which other products would cost more than that from Sunday. ""I saw some videos online that certain items like storage boxes that usually cost $2 would now be $4.07. I didn't know what else would be different so I wanted to come down to have a look,"" she said. Retired shop assistant Madam Janice Teo, 62, was one customer who stocked up on plastic storage boxes. She said she uses the boxes to store her beads, as she enjoys making beaded jewellery in her pastime.

124,/threads/tiktok-is-eating-facebook-from-the-inside.6740137/,edwarde2," https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tiktok-is-eating-facebook-from-the-inside WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Last year, Facebook had a TikTok problem. This year, it has several. The Chinese-owned video app is eating Mark Zuckerberg’s social network from the inside, first by luring its users and now by challenging Facebook as a news source too. One way that’s showing up is in slowing revenue and barely-there user growth. If Zuckerberg wants to beat TikTok, he’ll have to quickly copy it. Meta Platforms, Facebook’s parent company, said on Wednesday https://investor.fb.com/investor-ne...ports-First-Quarter-2022-Results/default.aspx that revenue grew 7% year-on-year, the slowest pace in about a decade. Facebook’s daily active users grew less than 2% from the end of 2021. The shares rose 15% in after-hours trading, but that’s because much damage had already been done. Meta took a beating in February when it partly blamed TikTok for Facebook’s first quarterly decline in user growth. The stock is still down about 40% this year, double the fall in the Nasdaq 100 index. TikTok, being privately held, doesn’t disclose such numbers – but they’re likely to be heading in the opposite direction. It had almost 1.6 billion global monthly active users in the first quarter, less than Facebook’s 2.9 billion but roughly a 45% jump from a year ago, according to Data.ai. One reason is content. Its videos are compelling enough that TikTok viewers send content creators quasi-cash gifts. In the first quarter, users doled out more than $840 million on TikTok, a record for any app or game, Data.ai reckons https://www.data.ai/en/insights/market-data/tiktok-app-milestone-840-million-spend . In the fourth quarter of 2021, it was the first app to surpass games like ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Genshin Impact"" in terms of consumer spending. A new threat is news. Last September, Zuckerberg’s network was a regular news source for 31% of Americans versus just 6% for TikTok, according to a Pew Research Center report. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February – which brought TikTok a host of user footage from that country – changed that dynamic. Views of #Ukraine-tagged posts grew from 6.4 billion on Feb. 20 to currently about 40 billion, according to TikTok. In March, the White House briefed about 30 app influencers about the war. Facebook has already been trying to ape its upstart rival. Its own video feed, Reels, launched last September. It may have to go faster. About 37% of monthly active Facebook users are also on TikTok, and it’s 51% for Meta’s photo-sharing app Instagram, according to Cowen research. Imitation isn’t flattery – it’s self defense.

Kubur Kassim Cemetery’s striking yellow and green gates possess the Indo-Saracenic style of a mixture of Mughal and classical European features, a popular architectural design in Malaya in the early 20th century. The cemetery, which also houses a surau (prayer house in Malay), used to serve as the final resting place for the Muslims living in Siglap. Buried at Kubur Kassim Cemetery were some of the well-known community leaders, including former Singapore Municipal Commissioner Dr Hafeezudin Sirajuddin Moonshi, who became the first in Singapore to open a Muslim clinic in 1916. Another was Che Lembek binte Abdin, the former headmistress of Kampong Glam Girls’ School during the Second World War. For years, Kubur Kassim Cemetery has been a source of haunted tales.

I don't dare to Google. I don't know what may pop up. I don't mind a wall of text explaining what it is. Thanks Click to expand... Help you google The Orang Bunian supposedly resemble human beings and don't live too differently from us. Zainal, who is from University Malaya's Malay Studies Academy, explained that the Orang Bunian community live in another dimension of reality. But, like in this world, they too have families and their own social structure. There are no clear demarcations between our reality and the Orang Bunian's reality and you can't see their world with the naked eye. To enter their world, you must have the special ability to do so. ""Mediums or bomohs can ""befriend"" them. They are not spirits that you can manipulate or instruct like the Toyol or Jinn. ""There is a way of speaking to them. You can speak nicely to them by asking them to fulfil your requests, but if that does not work, at times you can also threaten them or make an offering or barter to come to an agreement."" Many believers of the Malay and Indonesian folklore say that the Orang Bunian is linked to the Minangkabau culture, originating from West Sumatra in Indonesia. The Orang Bunian is known to live in the forest or at foothills and sometimes near cemeteries and empty buildings. Some equate this community to elves while others believe they are built on a royal social structure, with kings, queens and princesses' in tow. These spirits are known to appear during sunset. The Orang Bunian are often used as a reason to explain cases of missing children or when people go astray in forests. From Wikipedia, In Malaysian, Bruneian and Indonesian folklore, Bunian people or Orang bunian (Indonesian pronunciation: [o.raŋ bu.ni.an]) are supernatural beings said to be invisible to most humans, except those with ""spiritual sight"". While the term is often translated as ""elves"", it literally translates to ""hidden people"" or ""whistling people"". Orang bunian are described as beautiful, dressed in ancient Southeast Asian style, and nearly identical to humans in appearance. Some mythological accounts describe the lack of a philtrum. Modern depictions of Orang bunian deviate from the traditional folklore by including elf-like features, pointed ears, high fantasy-influenced attire, or modern Minangkabau long coat clothing.[1] Orang bunian are said to inhabit the deep forests or high mountains in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra & Borneo, far from human contact,[2] as well as near human communities, and are even said to share the same houses as human families.[3] According to legend, their social structure is similar to that of humans in the ancient Malay Peninsula, with families, clans, and royalty. As with other mythical beings in Indonesian folklore, Orang bunian often have supernatural powers,[4] and must be appeased with certain rituals and customs before humans are allowed to trespass areas which they inhabit. Orang bunian are generally regarded as benevolent, befriending and assisting humans, particularly magicians (dukun or bomoh) and shamans (pawang).[5] They are said to be able to intermarry with humans and bear invisible children.[6] According to some tales, men had married Orang bunian women but later decided to leave the bunian community and return to the families they had left behind. However, after returning to human society, they found that many years had passed and everyone they once knew had died. These narratives have been compared to Urashima Taro and Rip Van Winkle.[7]"

But since the share price has fallen, they might as well take it private, It is not about toxicity or causing others agony. It's just based on the best decision you can make at that point in time."

Razer down 35% from HKSE IPO Grab down 78% from NASDAQ SPAC acquisition List in SG, better for post IPO investors, but less benefits for founders/owners. Look at Sheng Siong. Listed at 35 cents on SGX. Now $1.52. All the value ($1.17 worth + 11 years of dividends) which could have been earned by the founder was earned by shareholders who came in after IPO instead. Another example is OSIM. It raised S$30m when they listed in 2000 on SGX. However, when they delist, he had to spend S$300m to take the company private. Super bo hua.

Click to expand... when u think like layman, u only earn 6.1% pa. if u think like razor ceo, what did he do for 2017 to 2022 to earn SGD2bn public $$$ ? get a bank to underwrite & lawyer & brokerage to do an IPO, maybe cost a few mil. do annual report, conduct agm over 5 yrs, make sure co biz is alive and stock doesn't suspend for 5 yrs, maybe cost another few mil. do a delisting exercise, cost a couple of mil. SGD2bn - 10mil = profit faster than producing and selling goods ? this is American style of capitalism. 【佛陀故事】2000多年前佛陀在《佛譬喻经》 在荒野当中，有一个人赶着路，突然他发现一块块白白的东西，仔细一看，原来是白骨。正在疑惑之际，突然传来惊人的咆哮声——一只大老虎紧逼而来。 他拔腿就逃，但迷失了方向，他逃啊逃啊，居然逃到了一座断崖绝壁的顶上，幸好断崖上有一棵松树，从树枝上垂下了一条蔓藤，他抓着蔓藤慢慢地垂下去。 这个老虎拼命地追，好不容易到口的食物居然被逃离了，在崖上狂吼着。一会儿老虎走了，他刚放下心，但是朝脚下一看，不禁：「啊！」 原来脚下是波涛汹涌的深海，波浪间有三条毒龙正张开着大口，等着他的坠落，把他吃了； 更危险的是，拉住他的蔓藤在根部有两只老鼠——一只白的和一只黑的——正在撕咬着这根蔓藤。 他摇动蔓藤想赶走老鼠，但每摇动一次，便有水滴从上面落下来。 原来是这个树枝上的蜜蜂巢所滴下的蜂蜜。蜂蜜太甜了，这个人舔着蜂蜜，完全忘记了自己正处于危险万分的惊恐境地。 这个故事是2000多年以前，佛陀在《佛譬喻经》当中讲的一个故事，故事中每一个事物都比喻着我们人生中的一部分。这个人就是我们自己； 荒野代表着无尽的寂寞人生；路边的白骨就是人生当中你的亲属、你的家眷、你的朋友过世后的白骨一堆； 饥饿的老虎比喻等待你自己的死亡，佛陀以恐怖的老虎来做比喻，让你知道，我们人生危险是随时随地的； 当你爬上崖顶的松树，拉住蔓藤，指的是你在危险的人生当中，你所赚取的金钱、名利、财产、地位，哪怕你拥有了这个蔓藤，也终有一天会断掉。 面临死亡，一样也带不走。当你抓住了蔓藤，是自我安慰的心态。想一想，我们人生几十年担惊受怕地度过，就犹如做梦一样，拉着蔓藤怕掉下去，山上又有老虎的危险； 不断咬着蔓藤的黑白老鼠指的是白天和黑暗，缩短着我们每个人的生命；水中的三条毒龙指的是我们心中的贪、瞋、痴，正等着吃掉我们的灵魂和我们的心； 在这个故事当中，蜂蜜是指人的欲望，我们在危险的时候，还在不停地去追求那些名和利，都不知道哪一天会掉到万丈深渊，看似甜蜜的蜂蜜，实际上那是痛苦的欲望啊！ 我们人的生命就是这样，每天拥有的一点点快乐和幸福，觉得那是我们拥有的，每天不断舔食着蜂蜜，不知不觉地赚了一点钱，为了一点名，在走向终点的堕落，这就是佛陀在2500年前对我们这么智慧的开示。 想一想，我们每个人的人生，每一天都在浪费，我们可以为了生活、为了生存造着无尽的业障，去无尽地浪费着生命。有时候为了一句话、为了一件事情，我们可以痛苦一个月，甚至一年。我们让自己和亲人、朋友都受着无尽的痛苦。 人生一共只有3万天，却一直在缩短着我们的寿命。所以，佛陀告诉我们：「一切有为法，如梦幻泡影，如露亦如电，应作如是观。」 2019.10.21吉隆坡法会 Reactions: benedium"

415,/threads/ex-grab-driver-acquitted-of-attempted-rape-of-intoxicated-19-year-old-passenger.6739414/,jonesftw," Justice Pang said the girl had consumed five pints of beer that night and was intoxicated, but this fact alone was insufficient to establish her lack of capacity for consent. He said that a lack of capacity for consent would require her to be unable to understand the nature and consequence of what she was consenting to due to intoxication. Noting that the girl was emotional and crying, and showed motor impairment such as an unstable gait, the judge said that drinking a substantial amount of alcohol or behaving unusually did not indicate a lack of capacity for consent. He also noted that the girl could not remember the sexual encounter with Tan. However, he said that the inability to form memories due to alcohol intoxication did not mean she was unable to perform cognitive functions. Justice Pang said the question to be decided was not whether the girl was intoxicated, but whether she lost the capacity to ""understand and decide"" on her actions. He said that the girl demonstrated this ability at multiple points during the night and cited a number of instances. At the bar where she had been drinking, she repeatedly rejected a friend's offer to drive her home and said she was okay. The girl testified that she did this to avoid worrying her friend. Justice Pang said this demonstrated her ability to look beyond her immediate needs and consider her friend that night. Later, after the car reached her home, the girl told Tan she was not ready to leave. She was searching for her wallet to pay the driver then, and this showed her awareness of the circumstances under which she would be ready to leave the car, said the judge. After the girl failed to access her residence, Tan asked her if she was okay and she said that she was. She testified that she responded in this way because she did not know Tan and did not want to say much, which also demonstrated awareness of her surroundings, said Justice Pang. In the car, the girl was emotional, thumping herself on the chest with her fist and banging her head on the window, but would stop each time Tan urged her to stop. This showed an awareness of what Tan was saying to her and her decision to accept his suggestion, said the judge. After the sexual acts, Tan asked the girl if she was okay, to which she replied yes and asked him to continue driving. This showed her ability to assess whether she wanted to leave or remain in the car with Tan even after the sexual encounter, said the judge. For reasons unknown, the victim did not go home and was found by another Grab driver at around 4.40am, lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing. Justice Pang also agreed with the defence's secondary argument that even if the girl was indeed unable to consent, Tan could have been mistaken and held the reasonable belief that she was able to consent. The judge noted that the factors he gave for determining that the girl had the capacity to consent were external, physical manifestations of her behaviour. He said the girl was able to respond relevantly and appropriately to Tan's questions and suggestions during the night. As part of his analysis, Justice Pang noted that the girl was unable to recall the sexual encounter and could not give evidence as to whether she consented. The assessment of whether there was consent therefore depended largely on the credibility of Tan's testimony, said the judge. He said that Tan's version of events had been consistent since his first police statement after his arrest, and added that the man could not have known back then that the girl was unable to recall what happened. ""I find the accused's testimony credible and accept his version of events,"" said Justice Pang. The judge also relied on in-car camera recordings of the exchange in Tan's car and CCTV footage of the girl from the bar and her residence to make his findings. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, defence lawyer Chenthil Kumarasingam said that Tan wanted to get back to his life and that his family had been through a ""a lot"" in the past four years. ""Him going back to his life is really all that he wants at the moment,"" said the lawyer.

On Wednesday, High Court judge Pang Khang Chau noted from a previous apex court decision that the mere fact that she was intoxicated was not enough to establish a lack of capacity for consent. That the alleged victim had drunk a substantial amount, appeared inhibited, or behaved unusually also did not indicate a lack of capacity for consent, which requires that a complainant is unable to understand the nature and consequences of what she consents to, the judge cited. That morning, Mr Tan had accepted a booking from the teenager to travel from Wild Seed Bar at the Seletar Aerospace Park to her condominium. It was his third booking of the night. When Mr Tan got there, her friend told him that she was drunk and passed her a plastic bag in case she needed to vomit in the car. She lay down in the rear passenger seat. She testified during the trial that she could not remember the encounter and could not give evidence as to whether she had actually consented. However, she could be heard crying and interacting with Mr Tan during the car ride in the in-car camera footage. Closed-circuit television footage also showed that her gait was unstable, Justice Pang noted. The judge said that it was not conclusive whether she could remember the sexual encounters due to an alcoholic blackout, and her inability to form memories due to intoxication did not mean she was “not able to perform cognitive functions”. The “ultimate inquiry” was not whether she was intoxicated, per se, but whether she lost the capacity to “understand and decide”, said Justice Pang. He added that the alleged victim demonstrated such a capacity at several points during the night, such as by repeatedly rejecting her friend’s offer at the bar to drive her home. She said it was to avoid worrying her friend, which Justice Pang said showed that she could look beyond her immediate needs and consider her friend’s. In addition, she had told Mr Tan when they got to her condominium complex that she was not ready to leave the car, and searched for money to pay for the ride. When she began saying no and pushed Mr Tan’s hands away, this conveyed an intention that she did not want to be touched and that she was aware of what was happening, the judge further noted. After the sexual encounters, she told Mr Tan that she was okay and asked him to drive. This showed an ability to assess whether to leave or remain in the car with him, Justice Pang said. Because of these and other factors, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she lacked the capacity to consent, he added. This meant that the legal burden of proof to convict someone accused of a criminal offence was not met. The prosecution, led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Muhamad Imaduddien, had accepted that because the alleged victim was unable to recall the incident, the credibility of Mr Tan's testimony was crucial in determining whether there was consent. Mr Tan’s version of events was consistent since his first statement to the police, Justice Pang said in accepting that his testimony was credible. The judge added: ""It is particularly relevant that the police statement was given at a point in time when the accused did not and could not know that the complainant was unable to remember what happened during the sexual encounters. ""It is also significant that his account is corroborated by the audio recordings from the in-car camera."" And even if the woman had lacked the capacity to consent, the judge said Mr Tan would have had a “reasonable belief” that she had the capacity. She had responded ""appropriately and relevantly"" to Mr Tan's questions and suggestions as well as to her surroundings. Following the court hearing, his defence counsel, Mr Chenthil Kumarasingam from Withers KhattarWong, told the reporters that his client was keen on getting back to his life after a four-year-long court process. The prosecution did not indicate if they will appeal the verdict."
