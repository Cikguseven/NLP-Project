https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/johor-traffic-police-gear-up-for-singapore-visitors-ahead-of-long-holiday-weekend.6740595/page-1,EddieTanSG," JOHOR BARU (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Police have put measures in place in anticipation of tens of thousands of vehicles entering Johor from Singapore during the upcoming holiday season. State police chief Kamarul Zaman Mamat said that based on figures from the two Customs, Inspection and Quarantine complexes here, about 70,000 people had entered Johor from Singapore daily since the border reopened on April 1. ""Maybe half of them came in their own vehicles - an estimated 35,000 vehicles coming in daily, and this is not even the full capacity of 400,000 daily commuters travelling across the border. ""Coupled with travellers coming from Kuala Lumpur and the northern states, we can expect heavy traffic and congestion in Johor Baru and other parts of Johor,"" he said. ""We will also work with other related enforcement agencies such as city councils, and deploy police personnel to 30 traffic congestion and 41 accident hot spots in Johor to monitor the situation and ensure smooth traffic."" Commissioner Kamarul Zaman was speaking to reporters after launching Ops Selamat, which begins on Friday (April 29) until May 8 to combat break-ins and minimise traffic accidents in conjunction with the Labour Day and Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrations, at the Skudai toll plaza yesterday. He also said Johor sees an average of about 200 traffic accidents with two deaths a day. ""A total of 432 police officers and personnel will be involved in Ops Selamat, including to monitor the deadliest road located in Batu Pahat,"" he said. ""My advice to road users is simple - drive according to the road regulations and be patient. ""You will reach your destination,"" he added. Datuk Kamarul Zaman also said the public could assist the police in fighting crime by sending relevant information and photos to the Johor police Facebook page. ""The public can get involved by sending us relevant and detailed information such as clear footage showing car registration numbers, road name, time and date of an incident. ""This applies not only to traffic offences but other criminal incidents too, so that we can take swift action,"" he said. This follows Inspector-General of Police Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani's call on Wednesday for the public to channel information or complaints regarding traffic offences to the police to conduct investigations. Johor traffic police gear up for Singapore visitors ahead of long holiday weekend About 70,000 people have entered Johor from Singapore daily since the border reopened on April 1. .

However, older laptops have much better keyboards, that's why I know some older thinkpads are in high demand amongst computing students overseas, in EU and US - cos of the excellent keyboards.

UKHSA is working swiftly with the NHS and public health colleagues across the UK to investigate the potential cause. In England, there are approximately 60 cases under investigation in children under 10. Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, said: Investigations for a wide range of potential causes are underway, including any possible links to infectious diseases. We are working with partners to raise awareness among healthcare professionals, so that any further children who may be affected can be identified early and the appropriate tests carried out. This will also help us to build a better picture of what may be causing the cases. We are also reminding parents to be aware of the symptoms of jaundice – including skin with a yellow tinge which is most easily seen in the whites of the eyes – and to contact a healthcare professional if they have concerns. Hepatitis symptoms include: dark urine pale, grey-coloured poo itchy skin yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) muscle and joint pain a high temperature feeling and being sick feeling unusually tired all the time loss of appetite tummy pain "

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/increase-in-hepatitis-liver-inflammation-cases-in-children-under-investigation.6728836/page-1,tmkedmw," Health authorities in Scotland and England are investigating what appears to be a spike in hepatitis cases in young children - mostly under six years old. Parents are being asked to look out for symptoms of the liver condition such as jaundice, dark urine, itchy skin, muscle pain, and a loss of appetite. What is hepatitis?​ Hepatitis is the catch-all term to describe inflammation of the liver tissue. It is often caused by a viral infection - but also by exposure to some chemicals, alcohol, drugs and certain genetic disorders. How were these cases spotted?​ A ""signal"" indicating a small but unusual rise in cases in young children was first picked up in Scotland. Eleven children aged between one and five with hepatitis have been admitted to hospitals in Lanarkshire, Glasgow, Tayside and Fife, mostly since the start of March. Normally there are about seven or eight childhood cases per year in Scotland which do not have an underlying diagnosis. That triggered an investigation by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) which looked back at hospital admissions in England since January. It is now looking into about 60 cases in children under 10, with the majority thought to be in toddlers and younger children. The patients involved were all sick enough to need hospital treatment though most are thought to have made a full recovery. What could be causing this?​ The most common forms of hepatitis - known as A to E - are caused by specific viral infections. However, in all the new childhood cases under investigation, those viruses have not been detected. The wide geographical spread of cases - across the central belt in Scotland and scattered across England - is also unusual, with no obvious connection between the children involved. That would appear to rule out any infection caused by contaminated food eaten at a school or nursery canteen, for example. Public Health Scotland said at the moment there is also no clear cause, but some sort of infection remains the most probable source. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, said: ""Investigations for a wide range of potential causes are under way, including any possible links to infectious diseases."" Could this be something to do with Covid vaccinations?​ Health authorities say there is no evidence to suggest a link to vaccination. All of the cases detected so far in Scotland, and the majority of cases in England, are in children between one and five years old. Covid vaccines are only available from five years old in the UK, meaning many of the children diagnosed with hepatitis would not have been eligible. What about a Covid infection itself?​ Covid has been linked to liver damage in the past, although it is more likely to be detected in patients with a severe form of the disease. Studies suggest small numbers of babies and children infected with Covid have needed treatment for hepatitis in other countries such as the US as well as Brazil and also India. In most of those cases, the patients recovered quickly and were discharged in days. UKHSA says it is looking at links to the virus as part of its investigation, along with a wide range of other infections and causes. Some of the children hospitalised in England did test positive for Covid and others for adenovirus, a common cause of respiratory illness in the young, but that doesn't necessarily mean either virus was responsible for this latest spike in hepatitis Childhood hepatitis: Why are we seeing an unusual spike in cases? Health authorities in Scotland and England are looking into 71 unusual cases of the illness. www.bbc.com"

Furthermore, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome of human cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of BNT162b2 on the human liver cell line Huh7 in vitro. Huh7 cells were exposed to BNT162b2, and quantitative PCR was performed on RNA extracted from the cells. We detected high levels of BNT162b2 in Huh7 cells and changes in gene expression of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1), which is an endogenous reverse transcriptase. Immunohistochemistry using antibody binding to LINE-1 open reading frame-1 RNA-binding protein (ORFp1) on Huh7 cells treated with BNT162b2 indicated increased nucleus distribution of LINE-1. PCR on genomic DNA of Huh7 cells exposed to BNT162b2 amplified the DNA sequence unique to BNT162b2. Our results indicate a fast up-take of BNT162b2 into human liver cell line Huh7, leading to changes in LINE-1 expression and distribution. We also show that BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA in as fast as 6 h upon BNT162b2 exposure. "

By 8 April, 74 cases had been identified in the United Kingdom. Hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, E, and D where applicable) have been excluded after laboratory testing while further investigations are ongoing to understand the aetiology of these cases. Given the increase in cases reported over the past one month and enhanced case search activities, more cases are likely to be reported in the coming days. Description of cases: On 5 April 2022, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for the United Kingdom notified WHO of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in previously healthy young children (age range: 11 months to five-year-old) across central Scotland. Of these 10 cases, nine had onset of symptoms in March 2022 while one case had an onset of symptoms in January 2022. Symptoms included jaundice, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. All 10 cases were detected when hospitalised. As of 8 April 2022, further investigations across the United Kingdom have identified a total of 74 cases (including the 10 cases) fulfilling the case definition1. The clinical syndrome in identified cases is of acute hepatitis with markedly elevated liver enzymes, often with jaundice, sometimes preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms, in children principally up to 10 years old. Some cases have required transfer to specialist children’s liver units and six children have undergone liver transplantation. As of 11 April, no death has been reported among these cases and one epidemiologically linked case has been detected. Laboratory testing has excluded hepatitis type A, B, C, and E viruses (and D where applicable) in these cases while Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and/or adenovirus have been detected in several cases. The United Kingdom has recently observed an increase in adenovirus activity, which is co-circulating with SARS-CoV-2, though the role of these viruses in the pathogenesis (mechanism by which disease develops) is not yet clear. No other epidemiological risk factors have been identified to date, including recent international travel. Overall, the aetiology of the current hepatitis cases is still considered unknown and remains under active investigation. Laboratory testing for additional infections, chemicals and toxins is underway for the identified cases. Following the notification from the UK, less than five cases (confirmed or possible) have been reported in Ireland, further investigations into these are ongoing. Additionally, three confirmed cases of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology have been reported in children (age range 22-month-old to 13-year-old) in Spain. The national authorities are currently investigating these cases. "

This occurred in a well man with no other medical problems. The onset of jaundice associated with the mRNA vaccine was unusually rapid. This was also illustrated in the other cases where symptoms developed over a median of 7 days (range 4-35). Latency is usually longer in other causes of DILI, but can vary depending on mode of injury. The mRNA vaccine pathway triggers pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon and cross-reactivity has been illustrated between the antibodies against the spike protein and self-antigens. Seven cases of suspected immune-mediated hepatitis have been reported with SARS-2-COV mRNA vaccines (3 with Pfizer and 4 with Moderna). Liver histology was assessed in every case and findings were similar to ours, indicating acute hepatitis with interface hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and absence of fibrosis. Eosinophils as part of the infiltrate, which can be noted in DILI were present in 3 cases. All 7 patients responded well to steroids (n = 5 prednisolone, n = 1 budesonide and n = 1 methylprednisolone). In 3 cases there were features suggesting coincidental autoimmune hepatitis: a 35-year-old lady in her third trimester of pregnancy with positive double-stranded DNA, an 80-year-old lady with a history of autoimmune conditions and a 41-year-old lady with strongly positive auto-antibody panel after both doses of vaccination. In the other 4 cases, a raised IgG, with at least 1 positive antibody was noted in 3 cases. This case has confirmed immune-mediated hepatitis secondary to the Moderna vaccine, which on inadvertent re-exposure led to acute severe hepatitis. Treatment with corticosteroid therapy appears to be favourable. We wish to highlight that immune-mediated reactions from the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are very rare and during the COVID pandemic, the vaccination programme continues to be crucial. We report this case to encourage vigilance for drug-induced reactions and to raise awareness to vaccination centres to incorporate it into their routine checks before administering second doses. Long-term follow up of identified individuals will be essential in determining the prognosis of this immune-mediated liver injury.

Among the cases of acute hepatitis , at least one child has died and 17 children have required liver transplants, the WHO said in a news release. ""It is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent."" The WHO said the investigation into the cause needs to focus on factors such as ""increased susceptibility amongst young children following a lower level of circulation of adenovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of a novel adenovirus, as well as SARS-CoV-2 co-infection."" The majority of the cases -- 114 -- have been reported in the United Kingdom. There have been 13 cases in Spain, 12 in Israel, nine in the United States and a smaller number of cases confirmed in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, France, Romania and Belgium, according to the WHO. On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory which alerted health care providers and public health authorities of an investigation into acute cases of hepatitis with unknown causes. The CDC recommended providers consider adenovirus testing in children with hepatitis when the cause is unknown, adding that testing the blood in whole -- not just blood plasma -- may be more sensitive."

Pay increment at the beginning isn't so much. Doctor = long career, I prefer short career. Also, I hate exams and hands-on stuff, so decided nvr to go for it even though I have the grades to enter. Yeah that's why I seldom hear of ppl that went to US for undergrad, except one of my ex-schoolmate, whose dad/mum early retired from a business.

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/chit-chat-with-mommy.6606184/page-19,Kuudere," The advice is to either do a major that you really like or do a practical one like business/IT. Most of my peers went for the latter, because Sg = high cost of living. Any major could be used to apply for med sch, but admission is far from simple. For instance, there is the medical admissions test apart from your uni gpa. Usually test, takes months of preparation and costs like few hundred dollars to take it. This test not easy too. Interview is the next worry. You have to prepare for this in advance. I have an interview book that I have lent out to my friend and she has returned me the book, she managed to get into medical school in NUS after reading the book haha. It took her two tries to get in though. The biggest concern is ultimately money. 4 years of medical sch even after finishing uni degree. Last I checked my uni cost fees was $320k for the 4 years. Because of inflation, the fees will increase more over time. $320k now will be $400k. This is of course contingent that you pass every year of studies. If fail one year = bye bye to $80k Smu is alright, I just never applied there, since I have no course that I was interested in doing over there. Also, I wanted to stay on campus, which only NUS/NTU provided at the time when I enter. "

Marketing, social media advertising etc is not cheap leh. And the capital for goods? If your moq is low then ur cost price is higher too. There’s a lot of consideration when u run a biz. U can only run a successful biz if u have a product that is unique and patented whereby not so easy for ppl to copy ur product. My f/t job now is definitely easier than if i were to run a biz again so i wouldnt want to do it anymore.

Instead of spending $100+ to replace the whole stainless dual tap, I managed to find and purchase the replacement brass ceramic tap valve on TaoBao. And the replacement valve only cost less than $5. I also bought extra ceramic disc and silicon washer. Did the replacement in less than 15min using Allen Key and a small adjustable spanner. Initially thought I can just change the ceramic disc and washer. But the whole valve was in a bad shape. So decided to replace the whole valve.

But make sure ur heart n mind is settled down by 27/28 and concentrate on pursuing the things that u want. Give urself some time to figure out ur goals in ur life. to me money does not really define how successful u r but ur attitude towards life. Do u give up easily when encountering bumps or figure out solutions instead. So to me i guess the attitude and character defines how successful u r at 25 lor.

The duty evaded amounted to more than half a million dollars, said the Singapore Customs on Friday (April 29). Officers saw the two men, aged 25 and 37, transferring boxes between a Singapore-registered truck and a car at a carpark near Lorong 8 Toa Payoh on Wednesday and conducted checks on them. One of the men tried to flee the scene but was stopped by the officers, and both men were arrested. A total of 4,540 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes were found in the two vehicles. The cigarettes and vehicles were seized. The duty evaded amounted to about $516,000 and the goods and services tax (GST) evaded was about $39,000. A packet of unknown white powder, suspected to be controlled drugs, was also found in the truck. Singapore Customs said that the matter has been referred to the Central Narcotics Bureau for further investigation. It reminded the public that offenders can be fined up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded and/or jailed for up to six years. Vehicles used in the commission of such offences are also liable to be forfeited. Last year, some 463,232 packets of illegal cigarettes were seized in Singapore. One of the biggest busts of illegal cigarettes was made on Jan 13, 2021, when 11,285 cartons and 7,685 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes were found hidden in Chinese God of Fortune figurines on a Malaysia-registered lorry entering Singapore.

Tanya Ong | April 29, 2022, 09:33 AM Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://t.me/mothershipsg Click to expand... COMMENTARY: This is an open letter to employers — can we please not revert to pre-Covid office arrangements just for the sake of it? It definitely doesn't have to be 100 per cent work-from-home (WFH), but please, anything but five days in the office. An earlier version of this article was first published in April 2021, shortly after the government announced that WFH would no longer be the default and up to 75 per cent of employees would be able to return to offices. Dear Singapore employers, As you already know, all employees may now return to the workplace — an increase from the previous limit of 75 per cent of those who can work from home. Perhaps you're secretly disappointed that you will have to return to the office more, or maybe you're pleased because you think that you can finally get your business back to the way it used to be. As the Covid-19 situation stabilises further, bosses like yourselves may be thinking of asking your employees to return to the office for as many days as possible. And perhaps eventually reverting to the pre-Covid-19 ""normal"". But I implore you: Can we not? Do we really need to be in the office five days a week?​ WFH has allowed many of us to sneak in an extra hour of rest or time with our family because we save on commuting time. A study by Microsoft also shows that staff have crafted and adapted to new routines, such as building different familial responsibilities and even exercise routines into their daily schedule. In fact, in a recent Institute of Policy Studies paper released in 2022, around 20 to 35 per cent of those polled said that working from home on most days should be the norm, according to The Straits Times. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""But having a work-from-home arrangement means less productivity!"" To that, I say: Didn't we already survive two years of this hybrid work arrangement? Were the KPIs and deliverables not fulfilled? ""But returning to the office will boost productivity and morale even further!"" Okay sure, I don't entirely disagree with that. But hear me out. Problems with a 100 per cent WFH model​ There will be some jobs where work-from-home is simply not possible, such as for those working in the healthcare or cleaning industries. But then there are companies where WFH arrangements are technically possible. In these instances, the fear is that bosses might be tempted to ask employees to return to the office for all five days a week, because that was just the way it used to be pre-Covid. After all, in Jan. 2021, then-education minister Lawrence Wong said during an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) forum that 100 per cent work from home is not possible . Many experts in Singapore also told CNA that working from home will not be a sustainable and optimum long-term solution for companies. And I get that. From a pragmatic perspective, there are many problems that come with a 100 per cent WFH model. For one, it's sometimes a lot easier to get things done in person. Having a quick conversation to clarify things in person is much more straightforward than having a prolonged discussion over text. Not to mention, in-person interactions can also have a positive effect on morale. Thanks to Covid-19, a growing number of people have started jobs and left them without even meeting their colleagues in person. Without the social aspect of being in an office, it's all too easy to become disengaged and disillusioned. A 35-year-old quoted by The New York Times (NYT) said that the lack of physical meetings made him feel like ""a name on a spreadsheet"". Like he was ""just someone you could hit delete on"". If the only mode of engagement at work involves an endless onslaught of virtual meetings, are you truly engaging with your colleagues? And an even more philosophical question posed by NYT : If you never met your co-workers in person, did you even work there? Finding that right balance​ The office, and all the human interactions it entails, is important for nurturing a sense of belonging and purpose. But what I'm saying is: Surely we don't need this in-person thingamajig all five days a week? If there's anything a pandemic has shown us, it's our capacity to adapt and get used to new modes of living and working. A complete return to the office feels maddeningly unnecessary precisely because KPIs (*insert any other corporate jargon that you fancy*) were still met during the time where working arrangements involved a combination of working from home/the office. All over the world, some workers have quit rather than give up WFH entirely, Bloomberg reported. If their company wasn't going to offer them this perk of flexibility, they would look elsewhere instead. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying we should all work from home all the time for the rest of our lives (although I do know of some people who would love that). So, here's my humble suggestion: Let those who are able to WFH do so for at least one or two days per week. The Wall Street Journal said that an estimated of 25 per cent of work time to be WFH after the pandemic settles down, but of course it will vary from company to company. It's entirely up to you to decide what works best for your organisation but I sincerely hope you will consider this suggestion. Simply because it no longer makes sense to return to the 100 per cent office-based model in the near future. Hybrid work arrangements are currently the norm, but it should really be the future as well. Sincerely, An employee.

However, at the office I am able to focus better without the domestic disturbances. Then again, there are also office disturbances - we all know of managers and colleagues who throw work at the last minute or disturb staff with unnecessary meetings or some other tasks while they are already busy clearing backlogged tasks. Working in some offices also has toxic environments.

So when they were home, they found they had nothing to do and were themselves very slack. It's a projection of their own insecurities. Managers in Singapore's SMEs have never learnt to calibrate employees by work done, rather than ""use of time"". Just because an employee is more efficient and faster does not mean you give him/her more to do than other employees who are slower. It encourages people not to work fast and reduces productivity overall. That's why so many people wayang in the office, but at home they are able to get work done fast because they need to clear to see to other things that arise.Those who have worked in MNCs and learnt their culture struggle to work in SMEs because of the stupid micromanagement by some incompetent managers. There's a blind adherence to working people hard, rather than smart. Even if new ways have been proven better. Still remember my first job, when emails were distrusted by management so we had to print and fax everything - we couldn't even directly send to the fax machine from the computer without printing. Must print, fax, and shred. And this despite the other side asking for scans and emails cos they don't want to handle so much paper. "

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/official-2022-formula-1-season.6687066/page-18,Jurchen," Yuki came with the Honda engine supply to Alpha Tauri.  So no Yuki, no Honda engine.  Has been the case since the 1980s with drivers like Satoru Nakajima and Aguri Suzuki. Same with Takuma Sato in the 2000s. They got their seats courtesy of Honda.  That's one thing I respect about Honda - always providing opportunity for their own nationals to get into F1 through their engine supply to non-works teams. Unless Williams is also supplied by Honda, a direct Yuki-Albon switch is quite improbable.  Williams will never hire Yuki on merit.  They might take him if he brought huge sponsorship $$$ to the team or Honda agrees to supply Williams with engines for free/discounted price with Yuki onboard as a package. "

He wasn't obstructed by other cars and had no car trouble during his run.  His mistakes on each of those 2 laps were of his own making. Given Ferrari's current performance advantage over the rest of the field bar Red Bull, it says a lot about Sainz's underperformance when he is outqualified by both McLarens, both Mercedes and an Alpine. Yes, Sainz had his moments of brilliance but it's his inability to deliver on a consistent basis when it mattered most under pressure that annoys.  A driver can top every practice session but it means nothing if he can't deliver during final qualifying or race day.  Given Ferrari's current level of competitiveness, isn't it reasonable to expect minimum P4 in qualifying position on clear laps if there are no car mechanical/engine issues?"

This could mean that Singapore's Marina Bay Circuit could see two races this year, with the earlier race replacing a slot previously held by the now-terminated Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, thereby allowing F1 to maintain a record-setting 23-race calendar in 2022. The Singapore race is presently slated for Sept 30 to Oct 2, while the Russian race was scheduled to be from Sept 23 to Sept 25, until the latter was cancelled following its host country's invasion of Ukraine. ---- hmm, sounds like what happens in Austria and styrian grand prix. If really going to race 2 times, they should host an alternative site, maybe a south buona vista road. The talks to replace Russian GP , the likes of Sepang and Qatar has fall through. Autosport Click to expand... ""The idea has been discussed with the promoters in Singapore, which could possibly run the two races on consecutive weekends at Marina Bay Street Circuit at slightly different times of day, starting one at dusk before the other retains the traditional 8pm start for a full night race.""

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/just-hooted-flight-ticket-and-now-in-bangkok-liao.6655209/page-1,FireEmblem," Haha clearing leave Dec 14 to 27. So just last minute decide to go somewhere. Flight ticket from scoot, considered pre-covid price already for the year end period and very last minute booking at $240 including return flight 20kg baggage. Haha now still reading up on covid test requirement. And must book a SHQ extra + hotel stay for 1 night at least. Anyone actually went bkk recently got more info on what should I expect on arrival? First time travel so apprehensive Ok steps to get your thai pass 1) Get your vaccination certification via https://www.notarise.gov.sg/ In this vaccination certificate, there are two pages and in the second page, you will find the QR code that is needed to be cropped out in microsoft paint for upload to thai pass registration page 2) Book your SHA Plus + hotel. I did my booking in Agoda but kenna bluff that not all SHA Plus + hotel comes with the PCR test and airport transfer as required by thai authorities to let you into thailand. See the two bookings below, once comes with pcr test, one does not even thou both are the required SHA Plus + hotel you must book for first day. So make sure your booking comes with PCT test and airport transfer. Some of the SHA Plus + hotel does not provide this and if you book this for your first day, thai custom will not let you into Thailand. (Actually if you did booked a hotel that does not comes with pcr test and airport transfer, if you request, they probably can arrange for you but it will be charged as ala carte special request and the hotel will be charging a big premium apart from the price you paid for the room). After booking, hotel will contact you to get your flight number and time of arrival to arrange the airport transfer/PCR test and also crucially to give you a cert that your hotel + transfer+PCR test is paid. You need to upload this cert to Thai pass website as prove of hotel booking. If hotel nvr give u this, chase them for it zombie images free 3)Purchase your travel insurance and ensure that it cover medical cost for covid 19 amount at least 50k USD. Some travel insurance are not honest, they put the medical coverage for a certain amount but this medical coverage does not cover covid. Example i saw was Aviva and FWD. Aviva put medical coverage at 200,000 SGD but if you spend time to look into the exact coverage inside one of the many pages of the brochure, says for covid 19, only 10,000 sgd is covered for covid 19. So do not anyhow buy, read carefully to ensure you have covid 19 coverage as per required from thai authorities. Once you have all these Go to below site to register for your thai pass. If you goggle yourself, there are some sites that looks like it is for registering thai pass but is infact registering on your behalf and will charge you money Thailand Pass Registration System (for air travel only) The bad thing about this site is that all the upload location does not accept pdf, so you will need to screenshot your pdf and paste them into microsoft paint to save as jpeg. For insurance policy, as your insurance policy has many pages, first you need to convert your pdf into each page image jpgs PDF to JPG - Convert your PDFs to Images online for free No downloads, no ad watermarks - just a great free online tool to convert your PDF pages to images or extract single images from your PDFs. smallpdf.com Then once you get the many jpgs of each page of the policy, use below to merge into one jpg Merge JPG to JPG Free online JPG to JPG merger. Convert multiple files. products.aspose.app Thereafter your Combined JPG will likely by over the 5mb limit, use below to compress to below 5mb. Mine from 9.2mb become 2.8 mb https://compressjpeg.com/ For thai pass, if you need to urgently get approval, try this. Email In case your registration takes too long, contact testgo @consular.go.th for enquiries about your registration status.

Once you step out there is a line of table with the respective hotels. Go there show they your booking and wait for your personal van. The van will bring you to the hospital to do PCR swab while you are in the van. Once swab done the driver will bring you to the hotel.

Initially scared me that I will not be able to book a pre departure test on such short notice Next I went to google more and found that SIA's website got a list of approved clinics who can provide pre departure test but these are more expensive, called a few and ranged from 142 to 170. Settled for the 142. So lesson learn is it is not a good idea to depart on a Tuesday as 72 hours means need to take on Saturday or Sunday and many not open on Saturday/Sunday or said they dun do pre departure PCR on weekend "

Some people didn't know the various requirements and necessary things for visiting Thailand under a few different schemes.  So when they screwed up, they blamed the hotel etc. For e.g. they booked a cheap hotel room without the necessary PCR test, transport transfer from airport to hotel etc. So when they discovered they had to pay for the necessary PCR test, transport to hotel etc. only upon arrival at BKK airport, they said they got scammed. The fault actually lied with them. Not all hotel guests are foreigners coming from abroad.  Many are locals or foreigners who are already in Thailand and they don't need the PCR test or transfer from airport to hotel etc.   So the room booking of some hotels do not include them.  In addition, some hotels do not offer them because they do not have the resources to offer the whole package. So it is the person's responsibility to find out what he needs and then make the hotel booking correctly. It is ridiculous not to do proper research, make mistake and then call it a scam. "

We may not be allowed to get our own transport from airport to the 1day quarantine hotel, so always check with the hotel if they offer it for free. This is where booking directly with the hotel is better. You can ask for free or cheaper transfer from the airport to the hotel. Also, do check if grab food delivery is allow. The on arrival PCR test result may take few hours to release and you could be very hungry during the ""quarantine"". Grab food is all in Thai, even though we are using our app downloaded in SG. Just look at the photos and click pay. Remember to pay using your credit card. Ask the hotel staff to bring it to your room when it's delivered. "

So because need to apply Thai pass fast, I made a booking thinking it will fit Thai pass criteria (any SHA plus+) hotel. I thought I just book any can already and since it is in the list of approved hotel, thought PCR test and airport transfer is in the package price especially when I know this hotel last time charge much lesser. Turn out their high price room is a staycation package and thus priced like 3x their normal room rate. I thought it was cause include PCR test and airport transfer thus much more expensive. So I booked it and it was under non refundable status. I found out later this hotel booking cannot pass Thai pass application and the hotel quoted me a price for the PCR test and airport transfer that is higher than me book another room elsewhere with PCR test and airport transfer so I booked the other especially since I cannot even book the higher price as still need to reply the hotel my flight info and arrival time before waiting for them to confirm this PCR test and transfer.

In fact, many of my friends can go for holidays for 3-4 weeks or even longer. If I want to, I also can go for 3-4 weeks or longer. I am not saying everyone can and should go for 3-4 weeks. Basically, if a person is able to and has a choice, it is better to go for 3-4 weeks instead of just 1-2 weeks. When I say it is better to stay in cheap hotels, I am mainly referring to people who have a budget which gives them 2 type of choices : 1) stay in expensive hotels for 1-2 weeks and try not to spend much on food, transportation and other things. or 2) stay in cheap hotels and use the savings to stay longer (3-4 weeks), stay in more places (for e.g. BKK + Chiang Mai + Pattaya instead of just BKK), visiting more places of interests, better food, transportation and other things. Many people are not value conscious in that they stay in S$150-$200 per night hotel and then try to save $5-$10 every time when eating and visiting various places of interests.  They do not realise that that their sleeping and bathing cost them $150-$200 per night and they try to save $30-$50 per day from food, transportation etc.  It is better value to spend $50-$100 per night on hotel and use the $50-$100 per day savings to go to more places, better food, better transportation etc, "

I already received a Thailand Pass QR Code, will be going Bangkok from 26-31 Dec for a short 5 day trip. 1. I am wondering if I am still allowed to enter since I only have a 5 day stay at the approved SHA++ hotel in Bangkok. 2. I intended to take ART / PCR test on my Day 3/ Day 4 initially before flying back, now it is not clear if I have to take another test on Day 5 on the day of my flight as well? Appreciate it if anyone could help or could point me in the right direction about who I can ask to confirm these info. Thanks! Quote from the Tourism Authority of Thailand website: Travellers who have already received a Thailand Pass QR code, and will be entering Thailand from 24 December, 2021 onwards will be subject to the requirements as follows: 1.They must have proof of a confirmed payment for at least a 7-day stay at an approved accommodation ; such as, a SHA++ hotel, within a Blue Zone Sandbox destination. The prepayment must also include the expenses for 1 RT-PCR test. 2.They must undergo their second COVID-19 test using the RT-PCR technique (not ATK self-test) at government-designated facilities on Day 5-6 of their stay, or when they experience respiratory symptoms (no additional cost). The test must be arranged by their respective prepaid accommodation. (Updated 23 Dec) Sandbox entry rules from 1 April 2022 - TAT Newsroom Travellers who plan to continue their journey to other Thai cities are required to stay at least 5 days (nights) in the Sandbox destinations, but the COVID-19 testing requirement has been revised to 1 RT-PCR and 1 self-ATK, while the health insurance coverage has also been reduced to no less... www.tatnews.org"

He said that a lack of capacity for consent would require her to be unable to understand the nature and consequence of what she was consenting to due to intoxication. Noting that the girl was emotional and crying, and showed motor impairment such as an unstable gait, the judge said that drinking a substantial amount of alcohol or behaving unusually did not indicate a lack of capacity for consent. He also noted that the girl could not remember the sexual encounter with Tan. However, he said that the inability to form memories due to alcohol intoxication did not mean she was unable to perform cognitive functions. Justice Pang said the question to be decided was not whether the girl was intoxicated, but whether she lost the capacity to ""understand and decide"" on her actions. He said that the girl demonstrated this ability at multiple points during the night and cited a number of instances. At the bar where she had been drinking, she repeatedly rejected a friend's offer to drive her home and said she was okay. The girl testified that she did this to avoid worrying her friend. Justice Pang said this demonstrated her ability to look beyond her immediate needs and consider her friend that night. Later, after the car reached her home, the girl told Tan she was not ready to leave. She was searching for her wallet to pay the driver then, and this showed her awareness of the circumstances under which she would be ready to leave the car, said the judge. After the girl failed to access her residence, Tan asked her if she was okay and she said that she was. She testified that she responded in this way because she did not know Tan and did not want to say much, which also demonstrated awareness of her surroundings, said Justice Pang. In the car, the girl was emotional, thumping herself on the chest with her fist and banging her head on the window, but would stop each time Tan urged her to stop. This showed an awareness of what Tan was saying to her and her decision to accept his suggestion, said the judge. After the sexual acts, Tan asked the girl if she was okay, to which she replied yes and asked him to continue driving. This showed her ability to assess whether she wanted to leave or remain in the car with Tan even after the sexual encounter, said the judge. For reasons unknown, the victim did not go home and was found by another Grab driver at around 4.40am, lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing. Justice Pang also agreed with the defence's secondary argument that even if the girl was indeed unable to consent, Tan could have been mistaken and held the reasonable belief that she was able to consent. The judge noted that the factors he gave for determining that the girl had the capacity to consent were external, physical manifestations of her behaviour. He said the girl was able to respond relevantly and appropriately to Tan's questions and suggestions during the night. As part of his analysis, Justice Pang noted that the girl was unable to recall the sexual encounter and could not give evidence as to whether she consented. The assessment of whether there was consent therefore depended largely on the credibility of Tan's testimony, said the judge. He said that Tan's version of events had been consistent since his first police statement after his arrest, and added that the man could not have known back then that the girl was unable to recall what happened. ""I find the accused's testimony credible and accept his version of events,"" said Justice Pang. The judge also relied on in-car camera recordings of the exchange in Tan's car and CCTV footage of the girl from the bar and her residence to make his findings. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, defence lawyer Chenthil Kumarasingam said that Tan wanted to get back to his life and that his family had been through a ""a lot"" in the past four years. ""Him going back to his life is really all that he wants at the moment,"" said the lawyer. Ex-Grab driver acquitted of attempted rape of intoxicated 19-year-old passenger SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Wednesday (Apr 27) acquitted a former Grab driver of the attempted rape of an intoxicated 19-year-old passenger in 2018.

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/ex-grab-driver-acquitted-of-attempted-rape-of-intoxicated-19-year-old-passenger.6739414/page-1,jonesftw," On Wednesday, High Court judge Pang Khang Chau noted from a previous apex court decision that the mere fact that she was intoxicated was not enough to establish a lack of capacity for consent. That the alleged victim had drunk a substantial amount, appeared inhibited, or behaved unusually also did not indicate a lack of capacity for consent, which requires that a complainant is unable to understand the nature and consequences of what she consents to, the judge cited. That morning, Mr Tan had accepted a booking from the teenager to travel from Wild Seed Bar at the Seletar Aerospace Park to her condominium. It was his third booking of the night. When Mr Tan got there, her friend told him that she was drunk and passed her a plastic bag in case she needed to vomit in the car. She lay down in the rear passenger seat. She testified during the trial that she could not remember the encounter and could not give evidence as to whether she had actually consented. However, she could be heard crying and interacting with Mr Tan during the car ride in the in-car camera footage. Closed-circuit television footage also showed that her gait was unstable, Justice Pang noted. The judge said that it was not conclusive whether she could remember the sexual encounters due to an alcoholic blackout, and her inability to form memories due to intoxication did not mean she was “not able to perform cognitive functions”. The “ultimate inquiry” was not whether she was intoxicated, per se, but whether she lost the capacity to “understand and decide”, said Justice Pang. He added that the alleged victim demonstrated such a capacity at several points during the night, such as by repeatedly rejecting her friend’s offer at the bar to drive her home. She said it was to avoid worrying her friend, which Justice Pang said showed that she could look beyond her immediate needs and consider her friend’s. In addition, she had told Mr Tan when they got to her condominium complex that she was not ready to leave the car, and searched for money to pay for the ride. When she began saying no and pushed Mr Tan’s hands away, this conveyed an intention that she did not want to be touched and that she was aware of what was happening, the judge further noted. After the sexual encounters, she told Mr Tan that she was okay and asked him to drive. This showed an ability to assess whether to leave or remain in the car with him, Justice Pang said. Because of these and other factors, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she lacked the capacity to consent, he added. This meant that the legal burden of proof to convict someone accused of a criminal offence was not met. The prosecution, led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Muhamad Imaduddien, had accepted that because the alleged victim was unable to recall the incident, the credibility of Mr Tan's testimony was crucial in determining whether there was consent. Mr Tan’s version of events was consistent since his first statement to the police, Justice Pang said in accepting that his testimony was credible. The judge added: ""It is particularly relevant that the police statement was given at a point in time when the accused did not and could not know that the complainant was unable to remember what happened during the sexual encounters. ""It is also significant that his account is corroborated by the audio recordings from the in-car camera."" And even if the woman had lacked the capacity to consent, the judge said Mr Tan would have had a “reasonable belief” that she had the capacity. She had responded ""appropriately and relevantly"" to Mr Tan's questions and suggestions as well as to her surroundings. Following the court hearing, his defence counsel, Mr Chenthil Kumarasingam from Withers KhattarWong, told the reporters that his client was keen on getting back to his life after a four-year-long court process. The prosecution did not indicate if they will appeal the verdict."

It shouldn't be incriminating to do it with someone tipsy. Even one is being tipsy, one still possess concious to make decisions. Unlike wasted, which would have been a straightforward ruling. If being tipsy (high) absolves one of responsibility, does it mean such person can commit crimes and later account his/her actions on the basis of intoxication? The implications are clear.

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/ex-grab-driver-acquitted-of-attempted-rape-of-intoxicated-19-year-old-passenger.6739414/page-12,Seansg," Your reasoning is flawed, intoxication slows a person's motoring function thus it's dangerous for a drunk person to be behind the wheel both for him and the ppl on the road. An intoxicated person is definitely capable of deciding whether he/she wants to be driving that car or not... whether he wants to break the law or not. An intoxicated person is also capable to be feeling horny at the point of time and decides if he or she wants to open up their legs and be pleasured or not. Note to mention, the girl had said ""No"" at a point of time and the driver stopped his action. So how is it that in this case, it was being forced upon her? She was not delirious, she was still able to demonstrate her action and her thoughts. Unless you never been drunk before, if not you will surely know whats going on in the head when a person is intoxicated. If you ask me if the driver had taken advantage of the situation or not? Yes he did.. and that's definitely not admirable of him. That's why I say, the audio shd be made public so we can have a better in depth understanding of the case~ Last edited: Wednesday at 4:10 PM "

Today's judgment is a blue moon and it banks on the account transpired in the PHV. I'm sure the Justice and the prosecutors ain't primary school kids who don't know how to look at evidences presented in a prejudiced manner. Frankly I'm very glad that Justice Pang presided over the case in a strong clear headed manner. You know, at least these kind of Judge let the men have a ""chance"" at what truly happened. This country with it's Woman's charter so so strong, already threw how many men's lives to the pithole with it banking so strongly on the ladies side? Most of the time when the guy is acquitted of the charges, how much damage is already done to the life of the guy? Yet, even when proven the girl is lying etc, she gets off scot free.

She later agreed that this demonstrated her ability to express that she did not want to be touched. This showed her awareness of what was happening and an ability to give or refuse consent, said Justice Pang. Tan's lawyer previously said that his client stopped what he was doing the moment the girl said no, and ""honoured"" her refusal . After the sexual acts, Tan asked the girl if she was okay, to which she replied yes and asked him to continue driving. This showed her ability to assess whether she wanted to leave or remain in the car with Tan even after the sexual encounter, said the judge. He said that Tan's version of events had been consistent since his first police statement after his arrest, and added that the man could not have known back then that the girl was unable to recall what happened. ""I generally accept the accused's account of events. I find that he was a credible witness,"" said Justice Pang. The judge also relied on in-car camera audio recordings of the exchange in Tan's car and CCTV footage of the girl from the bar and her residence to make his findings."

There are 6 points mainly involving internal and external consistencies before a Judge decides to convict or acquit. I forget what the full 6 are. Some bits from previous judgmentsL In Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 (“GCK”), a case involving a charge of outrage of modesty, the Court of Appeal elaborated on the “unusually convincing” standard that applies where the witness’ uncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for conviction. T he Court stated at [88]–[90]: 88 The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case [is] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence” : see Mohammed Liton ([32] supra) at [38]. In Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals [2016] 5 SLR 636 at [28], this court considered that (citing Mohammed Liton at [39]): … a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’. The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’s demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence. 89  … In the absence of any other corroborative evidence, the testimony of a witness, whether an eyewitness or an alleged victim, becomes the keystone upon which the Prosecution’s entire case will rest. Such evidence can sustain a conviction only if it is “unusually convincing” and thereby capable of overcoming any concerns arising from the lack of corroboration and the fact that such evidence will typically be controverted by that of the accused person: see the decision of this court in AOF v Public Prosecutor [2012] 3 SLR 34 (“AOF”) at [111]. 90  Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard entails that the witness’s testimony alone is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt: see Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor [1996] 2 SLR(R) 890 at [73]. The overwhelming consideration that triggers the application of the standard is the amount and availability of evidence: see also Kwan Peng Hong ([72] supra) at [29]. he Court of Appeal in GCK at [144] also explained the “unusually convincing” standard: The assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing” standard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence … The totality of the evidence logically includes the Defence’s case (both as a matter of the assertions put forth by the accused person, and the evidence he has adduced). The evaluative task here is not just internal to the Prosecution’s case, but rather, also comparative in nature. Where the evidential burden lies on the Defence and this has not been discharged, the court may find that the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt … At this stage of the inquiry, regard may be had to the weaknesses in the case mounted by the Defence as part of the assessment of the totality of the evidence."

She was later found lying in the middle of the road some distance from the condo by another Grab driver, who called the police. After the sexual encounter, when Tan asked if she was okay, she replied yes, before telling him ""just drive"". Justice Pang added that he generally accepts Tan's account of events, which has been materially consistent since the first statement he gave to the police after his arrest. It is particularly relevant that Tan gave the police statement at a point in time when he could not know that the woman was unable to remember what had happened. It is also significant that his account is corroborated by the audio recordings from the in-car camera, said the judge. The judge added that Tan genuinely believed that the woman had the capacity to consent. He noted that the audio recording captured Tan telling her ""I can't put it in"", followed by sounds of shuffling. ""This statement must have been made because the accused believed that the complainant was able to understand what he was saying and react accordingly and appropriately in a consensual manner to what he said,"" the judge said."

When you are young at 19 and even if you did consent to having sex with an uncle more than twice your age, it's very likely that the regret will come swiftly (especially if one is intoxicated and did things while tipsy). But that is after sex regret. It's NOT rape. There is a very big difference. "

If, just because a person is drunk, is deemed to be unable to give consent purely because she is drunk, it opns up a lot of issues. Let's not say rape or sex.  When the bill comes for the beer in the pub, is her signature for credit card bill valid?  She call for a cab.  Should the cab driver even let her in?  Even if she can give address and everything?  Cos she go into the cab for a ride home but maybe she didn't want a cab anyway.  She was mentally impaired by the alcohol so her call for cab is invalid.  It's like a 3 year old want to enter the cab without the parents around. The cab driver cannot just drive off.  Etc. So going by very strict definition, you cannot say just because she is drunk, she is mentally incpable of consent.  Cos once you do that, the next time you collect payment from someone who is drunk, he can contest it.  Heck, he can order 2 bottles of the most expensive beer and then say i was drunk, don't know what i ordered so not my problem I am not paying.... Cos when a judge makes a decision, it can easily become a precedent.  Nobody is going to say if you are drunk, you cannot consent to sex but you can consent to anything else. "

I think what the article meant was, the investigation relied on the audio that came from the car's dash camera. The dash camera is facing front so the video part is only showing where the audio has taken placed, when the car was stopped somewhere and where the sexual encounter took place. Whereas the audio is the key evidence that showed the correspondence between the girl and the man, which most likely helped to prove the man's innocence.

And you deem it fine that grab driver proceed to assault her even though upfront, she had said 'no'? Also, after the sexual act, did she say ok perhaps because she didn't want to agitate the driver further (and so she then told driver to drive on)? Did she really say ok because she was feeling perfectly fine with the sexual act? And most importantly, if she truly knew what she was doing, why then was she found lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing?

So, under the eyes of the law, the driver is not guilty (because he believed that the girl had given her consent). But from ethical point of view, noting that he was acquitted under the law, do you hence think the driver had done nothing wrong? So in future if a grab driver encounters similar situation (ferrying drunk girl home), can he too, cite similar reason and proceed to take advantage of his intoxicated passenger, and hope to get away with it after that - as with the grab driver in this case?

I never deem anything fine or otherwise.  Just making neutral statement. 2). When she said no, the guy stopped, didn't he? 3) i believe there were other statements where he said he can't get it in before that and she never rejected. 4). Ok means ok. She might have said it to avoid agitating the driver but you need proof for that. Otherwise imagine if one day after sex with your girlfriend or wife and you have a quarrel and they accuse you of rape, and ok did not mean ok, it will be a dangerous thing. 5). Her lying in public without the shorts and such.  Yes, i agree she does not sound like someone with mental capacity.  But even if she did not have the capacity then, prove that she also did not have the capacity with the grab driver.  Just because a person does not have capacity at 0200 does not mean he could not have the capacity at 0130. 6). I am inclined to believe your version of events but in the court of law, everything boils down to evidence and not it's common sense that this must have happened so this definitely happened.  This would be trial by emotions. Last edited: Yesterday at 8:48 PM "

The rest is just your POV vs mine so we just agree to disagree (if our views differ). Another question in my mind is, what's the purpose of law and penalty? Is it not to deter one from doing something which could cause harm to another innocent party? In this case, shouldn't the perpetrator be penalised to deter others from following suit?

Assuming she did not consume further alcohol after alighting the car, why did she suddenly become so drunk until she is found unconscious on the road?

No visual in the car and girl cannot remember. What was the driver doing with his hands? Who initiated? All based on his testimony. Girl drink until half naked on road should be testimony enough for her drunkenness and her inability to give consent. Strong lawyer for driver, girl got poor lawyer. Hope there will be an appeal. I do not think this is a fair judgement. Or at the very least, we should have more info on why he was acquitted. I do not find it convincing and too much leaning on the side of the driver due to good lawyering. Is the judge male or female? This could be factor too. It's really unfair girl was penalised for remembering some stuff while high to be taken as being able to give consent. That's nonsensical.

Not when she is lying in the middle of the road. I also disagree with one of the judge two findings. Mainly 1. The judge found 1) she had the capacity to consent 2)  it is likely the driver mistaken consent. The definition of consent. So the argument is whether she understand the nature and consequence of what she is consenting to. I think the judge is wrong to use evidence when she was in the bar to conclude the state of mind in the car else it is obvious she is incapable of anything later in the night. Honestly , nothing below shows any evidence that she is able to understand the nature and more importantly the consequence of her consent. -------------------------- ""Justice Pang said that there were several points that night where the woman had demonstrated such capacity. First, at the bar, she decided to reject her friend's offer to send her home and repeatedly emphasised that she was okay, to avoid worrying her friend. Upon arriving at her condominium, the woman told Tan that she was not ready to leave the car. She could also be heard in the audio recording of the in-car camera searching for her wallet in order to pay for the car ride. At one point in the car, she started saying ""no"" and pushing Tan's hands away. After the sexual encounter, when Tan asked if she was okay, she replied yes, before telling him to ""just drive""."" if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, mental incapacity, intoxication, or the influence of any drug or other substance, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or"

Being able to respond to some questions doesn't mean she's sober and can process when someone is drunk. Some reactions are instinctive, like auto-pilot replies. The judge probably has never been drunk in his entire life. Also, the girl has gone through a sexual assault. Her state of mind would be very very complex, and her response to the same question could be different on a different day. I don't think it is fair to judge her or her statement based in what a normal person under a normal circumstances would have behaved. This isn't a simple case of commercial dispute.

That's basic and should not even be disputed. Girl should also ensure that if go drinking, should always pace yourself and ensure u have someone reliable to take care of you.

I see some of you arguing that it's the girl's fault this happen. I am not sure how that's sustainable. By some of your logic it would appear some of you actually have the same mindset as men from mainland India where they think rape should be a free and ok thing as long as the girl is in a ''position'' to be raped, such as being out at 9pm becuz girls should have some self respect and stay home after dark. Just becuz A is at fault does not auto mean B is immune to having fault as well, one cannot argue A is at fault hence cannot blame B for the stupid things he does. If kid A punch kid B, does that mean we now accept teachers just watching show becuz kid B now ''have the rights'' to punch back? Yes you can argue the girl have a choice not to get drunk and should rightfully do so, but then the same goes for the guy too no? He also had the choice not to commit offense be it sexual or not and also rightfully should too no? If the next argument is cannot rely on others to protect u by the rights of ''should not'', then the problem here is not with the victim solely but becuz society endorses reprisal actions based on someone's else action. it's not consequences already, it's just another form of tit for tat.

[2020] SGCA 74 We would identify the following as the relevant general principles: (a) Under s 90(b) [of the Penal Code], a person who is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which that person has allegedly given his consent has no capacity to consent. (b) The fact that a complainant has drunk a substantial amount of alcohol, appears disinhibited, or behaves differently than usual, does not indicate lack of capacity to consent. Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done. (c) A complainant who is unconscious obviously has no capacity to consent. But a complainant may have crossed the line into incapacity well before becoming unconscious, and whether that is the case is evidently a fact-sensitive inquiry. (d) Capacity to consent requires the capacity to make decisions or choices. A person, though having limited awareness of what is happening, may have such impaired understanding or knowledge as to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act. (e) In our view, expert evidence – such as that showing the complainant’s blood alcohol level – may assist the court in determining whether the complainant had the capacity to consent."

And judge's opinion was that despite being intoxicated, she still possessed the capacity to give consent.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - Long queue of close to 80 people were seen at the Plaza Singapura outlet of Japanese retail chain Daiso on Thursday (April 28) ahead of the price hike from Sunday (May 1). The chain has been offering products such as stationery, snacks and homeware at a flat price of $2 since 2003. FromSunday, prices will follow a colour-coded tier ranging from $2.14 to $25.47. Housewife Sheila Begum, 35, heard of the price hike online and decided do some shopping. ""I wanted to avoid the weekend crowd, but seems like a lot of other people had the same idea,"" the mother of two said. She frequents the Japanese chain a few times a month as she loves collecting trinkets. She said: ""I will continue to shop here of course, but I wanted to stretch my dollar while I still can."" Queue at the Plaza Singapura outletwasat its peak when The Straits Times visited during lunch time. It extended past the cashier area and spilled over to shopping aisles around the store, making it hard for shoppers to move around. Preschool teacher Chua Xinyi, 26, said that she goes to Daiso to buyteaching materials such as mini whiteboards, chalk, and coloured markers. ""I think it's understandable that they had to hike their pricesbecause they are increasing almost everywhere. I'd rather they adjust their prices than close their shops,"" she said. Although she knew the price hike for some products would be just 14 cents, she wasn't sure which other products would cost more than that from Sunday. ""I saw some videos online that certain items like storage boxes that usually cost $2 would now be $4.07. I didn't know what else would be different so I wanted to come down to have a look,"" she said. Retired shop assistant Madam Janice Teo, 62, was one customer who stocked up on plastic storage boxes. She said she uses the boxes to store her beads, as she enjoys making beaded jewellery in her pastime. She said her niece had showed her a TikTok video that said the boxes would cost twice the price they do now - $4.07. Said Madam Teo: ""I used to come here because it was cheap and convenient, but I think I could find some things like these plastic containers cheaper at neighbourhood shops."" "

I believe they assigned many coaches etc to watch all the videos of lky just to find one or more weaknesses.  It may be speed, stamina, strokes etc or a combination of these factors.  For those who beat a top player from China, the emphasis would naturally be bigger.  In major competition, you can kind of observe that unseeded or low ranking players who are not likely to go far in that tournament will test their findings/hypothesis so that their seated players have better chance of winning that tournament. For countries outside of known powerhouse like China, a different approach or a combination is employed e.g. engaging or buying off top coaches who knows or familiar with top players playing style, strength etc.  In the good old days, players like Rudy Hartono, Morten Frost etc can hold on to their top spot and winning many tournaments.

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/unofficial-loh-kean-yew-badminton-fan-club.6566265/page-52,BHills," In badminton, playing doubles is a different ball game from playing singles. Things you should do or strategy you adopt in playing singles are most of the time bad for doubles play and vice versa. (This is also why badminton rackets very good for playing Singles are usually not very good for playing doubles.) A player good in playing singles is usually not very good in playing doubles and vice versa.  Once it reaches a high level, the more a player trains for doubles, the worse he/she will get in playing singles and vice versa. In addition, there must be a good understanding between the partners for doubles in what each of them should do, move, position themselves and who should receive/hit the shuttlecock under various situations during a rally. Therefore, a doubles pair consisting of world top male singles + world top female singles will still probably lose to any of the world's top 20 mixed doubles pair. Last edited: Dec 19, 2021 "

From the way he's playing at the moment, he's very fit, very fast in his movement around the court, much more matured as a player as compared to 2 yrs ago, more confident and most importantly, he seems to be enjoying himself. If he can beat all the seeded players in a top tournament in straight sets as well as have the crowd behind him then there's absolutely no reason why he cannot win the tournament.  The crowd was rooting for him in the SF, chanting ""Loh Kean"", ""Loh Kean"", probably because he was unseeded and the underdog who exceeded everyone's expectation. I believe his confident was boosted when he defeated Prannoy, a player who had beaten him 2 out of 2 and one who had beaten five world #1 players from different countries in different tournaments. If my memory serves me well, no unseeded player has ever reach the finals of a major badminton tournament.  So this, in itself, is already an astonishing achievement.

Up to Pri 4 level we still can compete with the top juniors in the region. The gap starts to widen from P5 and secondary onwards, when there is a need to balance academic priorities. We simply cannot put in as many training hours unlike others that live and breathe badminton. Another issue is teenage distractions. Even those in sports school will lag behind peers. By the time they reach 16 years old, if we are lucky we may still have 1 outstanding junior per batch, sometimes none. Unlike other powerhouses like China, Japan, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia that are spoilt for choices, just look at the numbers they send for the Asia U15 and U17 championships. We can then only try to remain competitive through superior coaching, fitness and sports psychology. Plus hope that the junior stays motivated and injury-free. Last edited: Dec 19, 2021"
