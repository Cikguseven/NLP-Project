You have a good heart and have a superior education in the one area that matters how you were educated in your home.
it was quite disheartening to read the comments on facebook
Because the people are not important. They can always import more immigrants.
Did we even acquire enough vaccines for everybody? UK produces their own vaccines if I am not wrong.
How about the Government should have expanded the Healthcare system capacity further more to cater to the ever-increasing population? Our hospitals have been operating near full capacity and hospital beds have been lacking long before covid happened.
Isn't our PM the one that wields the decision making authority? Lets be real, Ong Ye Kung and co. are just his mouthpieces.
Not sure which multiverse you come from but last I check, our Prime Minister is still Mr Lee HL. The person with the highest power to make any decision.
Pride and face project and tai-chi away responsibility are more important than the actual issue it seems
Taxes come from the people whether it is income tax or corporate tax.
The Government seems more excited about building Airport terminals and selling plot of land to developers for private property development than anything else.
There was never one to begin with. You were more like a jinx if I have to say.
There will be a 1 month waiver if I am not wrong.
They have but still not enough hospital beds for lower-middle income families demand for B class ward and below meanwhile we have more and more airport terminals throughout the years.
Why would they need your trust anyway? What have they done ever to earn trust other than enjoyed the trust that were earned by Lee Kuan Yew batch of pioneers.
Also, check the otters' temperature and give them a sticker to wear on their fur.

Purely speculation but this is usually seen as suicide by police, there are people that cannot bring themselves to do it so they purposely threaten a police officer to get them to use lethal force
Exactly the point! See the other comments in the thread. The webtoon isn't asking for more restrictions. They're simply asking they be given some respect, patience, and understanding as well.
Good job! Kudos for being so independent at such a young age. Though I understand your parents were toxic, but at least you were lucky that they were able to afford to support you when you were a minor.
Behaviour like that is extremely fucked up (pardon my french), sometimes humans can be real shits eh

Depends on family. Some people still have extant parents from the 50s and marry late. Tradition is a very hard thing to wean out of.
If the choice was between a party that does not serve yours or the nation's best interests, and a relatively unknown person, will you still vote for the People's Action Party because it is the devil you know?
Our nation is much like Animal Farm, some are more equal than others.
See, that is how you make an unknown, known. Not opposition politician likes facebook page of some pro-Malaysia critic, therefore he must love Malaysia more than Singapore accusations.
To be fair, National Service did quite a lot to acclimatize us to overwork so we're much more hardy than the Japanese in that regard.
You'd be surprised by how many people try to run their companies as if they were national service commanders. it is like civilian conversion has no effect at all.
then you can say you want to listen to music, not audio books
Maybe let's start from yourself. Why not being brave enough to call it 'invasion' as the whole free world does? Is that because CCP declared so to its proxy media?

Not differentiating between vax statuses, just why. Those who bothered has had enough time to register. Government cannot wish for higher vax rates when there's no carrot and the stick hits everyone equally.
Oh yeah of course, we should pander to those who believe in trampling over others in the name of their fairytales. Thank our beloved leaders for their wise teachings for benefit great nation of Singapore.

Yea I agree. Their solution to transgender students is to home school because transgender students will get bullied in school. Whereas sex education is actually the way to educate people.
Just get a dog. They're amazing n life changing Agree with getting dogs. that is the best we sinkies can do to meet our parental instinctual needs. At least the Government cannot send our dogs to their schools and national service.
In my 25 yrs working career, I have never said anything about my colleague's education. This is in very poor taste.

Most of the other malaysian politicians do not screw around and much as madhatter.
Russian citizens do not represent the kremlins. In fact many have protested the occupation of their evil comrades recently. But I would suggest these people of russia do condemn and reject their Government's occupation of Ukraine first.
Yes they can probably do it with a firmware update of the receivers. I read sometime back, it could be done either with or both different led colour and beep for vax/unvax
You could have easily gotten yourself bitten and turn into a chonky spider-man.

When you are a minister and still compare what secondary school the other guy you are debating with is from. So all school is a good school still stands?
Will our ministers stand and fight with us if a time like this ever comes? Or send instruction from their ivory tower I wonder.
He did not try to pull the Look like me, dress like me, sounds like me, feels like me but it is not me move?
Beyond deposit yes. But smells cost more than 2 months rent? If its more than that, its probably a deeper problem than cooking, no?
Yep that is all reasonable. But wouldn't it be better if you specify no cooking with strong spices ? Maybe apart from turmeric - Thai, Indo, peranankan curries also have similar ingredients.
the reason for my lack of sleep is not school but is that i always watch Premier League games which are usually at 1 to 2am and despite knowing i got school and need to maximise my sleeping hours
Because peace over here literally depends on whether or not a group of madmen up north gain enough political traction to liberate the poor, downtrodden Singaporean Moslems.
Honestly? Hard to say. Both have their pros and cons.
Singaporeans get what they deserve. I do not want to hear any more complaints
Just pass a temporary law for this. If they can do it for TT and mask wearing, they can do it for this too.
Time will tell is the only line that has not aged like milk over the past 2 years

That policy is bizarre especially if someone already has one shot in addition to natural immunity, though.

close the gyms because it is a closed environment that encourages spread. but not close dining in where masks have to be down to eat? I do not get the reactionary measures the Government takes these days.
The style of the artwork is on point! I can picture this in some PETS textbook
Because it is not about what school you are from or how smart you are. This behavior is just generally unacceptable and should be called out directly.
Another way of saying this is, if everyone is vaccinated, you will only have vaccinated deaths, and if no one is vaccinated, you'll only have unvaccinated deaths.
Uhm brother I rather they half measure and do it like this now than full measure and close off public transport also

I struggle to think of a single measure that is actually limiting the spread of covid. Ironically, the non mandatory anti bacterial gels everywhere probably help the most. Everything else singapore is doing is basically just security theater.
Such toxic behaviour also exist in MNC as well Of course it exists, but in my experience it is near universal outside of it, and especially in the civil service.
And Australia and New Zealand both stopped that, and they are all living near normal lives.
And people wonder why graduating students are choosing to work Grab over SMEs.
As long as Singaporeans sit content willing to accept whatever the Government says, they will never have to explain anything. And by god do Singaporeans sit content.
Just the Government panicking and flailing. We are well past the point of sensible, measured policy .
Long term it is pretty bad, but it really shows just how badly SMEs are falling behind in the modern economy.
New Zealand does it somewhat defacto with long ass wait times. http They just do not get as much bad press about it.

80s kid here, RV felt like that had a chip on shoulder thing bubbling under the surface (admission was 250 odd vs Hwa Chong 260+) and the communist glorify Confucian and China mindset. your experience may vary
God can drop stone tablet from heaven saying take the vaccine but they still won't.
Government idea of OT very different from outside private. They cosplay OT only.
are you bonded? if not, its not too late to chg ur mind. the industry is at a lowest morale here now in Singapore.
with these bunch of idiots , who's led by a Chief Clown?
After all, RI is literally the Singaporean branch of Eton. It was modelled after it.
I guess they changed the design so the younger kids can relate to the device better I would agree but who the fuck has a PS Vita besides the hardcore people?
I think the worst should be jp with all their overworking stuff, Singapore compared to that shouldn't be that bad
Umm unless you r a zoomer. We were using plastic notes till like 2000s?
I know plenty of people from non-wealthy families who are that way too. Come to think of it, my experience is the opposite of yours (the wealthier people I know tend to be more chill about their kids)
I agree. You do not need to be trained to use elbows and knees . Perhaps people are just saying that so it looks like they are knowledgeable about mma
No, do not use the button. Someone is literally about to die, but do not use the button
many people did and still do what the fuck are you talking about?
You know something's off when MPs, who are over 50, act like 13 year olds, that someone's education actually defines them.
That is not going to happen, especially Singapore foreigner policy has always been non alignment, we will not accept any refugees.
Ehh, at a certain age kids can make their own lunch just fine.
I would assume taking children to school does not count as a gathering? It would be hard to take both of my children at the same time if I can only be out in a group of 2.
I like to tell them Oh this, I sign up already, thank you , smiled and walk away.
call it out Yes. Call it out. If you stay silent, you are supporting and allowing the racist behaviour to continue. And the next generation of Singaporeans in your family will grow up thinking this behaviour is acceptable.
, thanks for the correction. Kinda remembered we had +7.30 GMT in the past, but I guess even that was a little off.
brother the wait at a certain a&e(not named for privacy) is 10-15 hours, it is mad. I do not know, does not seem like it is coping that well
the fuck no speculation but that is mad as f, Rest In Peace
yamaha electronic piano stowed away in utility closet/room I do not know man. sun still out is still reasonable though because early bedtime too.
Yep.I wake up a bit later at around 630 am but still feel drowsy,if i have time between classes i always take nap.
Wait, I remember instructions during guard duty in army national service was 1 warning shot in the air, and another below the waist if the attacker does not comply. Was it different for police? Or has it changed since?
If you see a suspicious person or article, please press the emergency button situated on the sides of the train doors
I want to do a documentary that focuses on my past as a former member of that megachurch and how I was practically brainwashed and gaslighted to believe their lies.
I will DM you a link of the documentary if it is completed one day. people do not talk about the toxic life they had under such charismatic churches but I hope my documentary will change their perspective.
Yes and these HOGC pastors abuse this overlying sensitivity to grow their so-called clout with the media
I love it when we talk about QOL in Singapore. Every Singaporean just decide that your Cost of Living can be lower if you accept that your QOL can be lower.
This also happened in a prestigious school too in a sense,not RI ACS level, but you have parents from good bg who would never expect their kids to face cases like these.
Singapore has always been, unfortunately. When myself and some others say this on reddit, we get quite a bit of defensive posts.
I am a Singaporean Indian Hindu, please ban all the flights, Singaporean live and health comes first than a fcuking nationality issue. Please all stay safe and secure!! Praying so that this covid 19 will pass away soon.
Sweat, heavy breathing, no masks, enclosed space. it is like a covid breeding ground. And yes, gyms have been scientifically assessed as high risk covid transmission locations. http
I think every school has a history of violent kids, just that very few escalate until death. When I was in CCHS in the 90s there were fights when teachers weren't around.
Shall we clap for this people who frequent the karaoke lounges?
Are you kidding? They will be hiding in the US
Ministers are like the emperor's new clothes then? If so they should be ashamed for not walking the ground. Ivory tower much?
KFC should spend less time memeing and more time asking themselves why their chicken is inedible compared to Jollibee's
why would I go overseas when I can go to Jollibee
well said girl! there is more to life than books.
Sleep is for the weak. Another 1st for Singapore! We can achieve!
I did not say it would be an immediate thing though. )
If the US can successfully tackle its internal issues, that will already be a huge boon to its global image.
We have signed up for tech restrictions on Russia, I think. Alongside Japan and Taiwan
Maybe he was pissed off being scolded at repeatedly under the hot sun during the many rehearsals. We need to hear from this boy!
that is japan no? Junko, I forgot if the people who did it got prosecuted since they were all school age. Did singapore have a similar case?
Not per capita they do not. Stop using statistics incorrectly to drive your narrative.
next stage will be Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) (Final) (For real this time)
I am illiterate and i got into RI woozy face some of the dumbest people i know are from RI, junior college elitism has really got to go laughing my fucking ass off
just because you identify as something you are not But how do you know they're not?
what more can you ask for. an actual Milo van arriving in the field
, sorry - I was referring to the first one about how almost all females have a level of sexual attraction to other females, more so than males.
But the whole point is they were protesting things that unnecessarily disrupt their day-to-day life in a very unpeaceful way.
hello minister the asian koel very noisy, wake me up every morning
I know a trans student who actually went all the way up and managed to get to speak to Lee Hsien Loong. no luck there either. maybe should try Halimah
I misread the title as Who do you think will win in a fight? and now I am disappointed.
in another incident, Ministry of Education told a 16 year old trans student to go for serious so he could change IC though
Is it ok to write to MPs who aren't our own, though? As far as I know, my MPs are very anti-LGBT.
men with washboard abs are arguably better at washing clothes
My friend says that the primary 3-4 kids she tutors send each other porn videos on their phones. times have changed
Not everyone gets that safety and stability, unfortunately, which is also why those are the people most likely to protest they have nothing to lose.
Not just US style Christianity, actual US Christianity. Lots of them get invited as speakers at churches, and conservative right-wing US sources are frequently reblogged and shared in local Christian social media circles.
one of my colleagues had covid and was working from hospital, which is the worst version of WFH
That would suck for LGBTQ Singaporeans who have partners overseas.
The Women's Charter says that a marriage will be considered legal if both parties were respectively legally male and female at the point of marriage , which was the case here. The provision was made explicitly for trans people.
Then why did ROM originally agree that she could get married even after she told them she was trans and planning to transition?
time to trick NUS sexual assaulters into holding up posters
Wait, what do you think is not fine with bisexuality specifically? (the phrasing suggests you think it is worse than homosexuality, when most people usually believe the opposite, so I am curious.)
Well, lesbians have a significantly lower risk of all sexually transmitted diseases, so if you are using the health argument then the Government should be encouraging that.
well, speaking as a trans Christian, this comment harms my religious feelings and harmony.
Everyday I laugh multiple times at the comical use of engrish I hear.
We've come a long way from Bag Down Benny and Hush Hush Hannah to Safe Distancing Sanders
But then they paid for him for three years afterwards? that is the confusing part of the story given the level of abuse.
I say this is a very concise way to address the issue with Ministry of Education and it is trashy sex ed and the homophobia, transphobia and stuff
Ministry of Education is literally in trouble. HOMOPHOBIAAAAA ( http edit also extreme transphobia
Nothing here in Punggol. Then again my passive perception is shit
Wanted to take rest day but guess I'll be panic gymming later
Not just yet, this stage is I cannot believe it is not circuit breaker. Sure smells and tastes like it, but it is not
They are great. All the guys and girls are really friendly and helpful.
It is nice if that will be good. However, looking at the resident's response in France I personally do not think Singapore Government will implement this anytime soon.
and the fine warning does not help to incentivize people to utilize it
Kneeling a guy in the head when on the ground just proves he is not tough but a pathetic human
Note to Self before using this resignation template for Monday it is definitely more than $17million already . Remember to edit before sending out
I got A2 in chinese for O levels but returned everything after exams. best i can do ia xue hua piao piao.
Ironically cannot close border as GDP affected but apparently ok to spend hundred of billions of reserve to do last min fire fight?
Nightmares of rising goods and services tax, stagnating wages and the prospect of never seeing our cpf money ever again.
Even without this I've been almost exclusively using them because their fares are almost always cheaper than Grab and Gojek
Big brother telling you what is good for you . cannot believe people are on board with this when vaccines do not even prevent the spread. Disclaimer I am fully vaccinated so take your personal insults elsewhere .
it is so bad to laugh but. I freaking dead when I saw this
Family separation is sad enough what's more the possibility of not being able to reunite. Unfortunately, I doubt there'd be any good outcome from the war for them.
Read that uploader is the wife of blue shirt man, the umbrella belonged to them.
So far all the discussion centred on being assertive which is really useful. Anyway, when approached, I simply told them I do not like audio books. So they left me alone. .
This is the most adorable thing I've seen today!! I watched a video of an alpaca running so that is saying a lot
Isn't chonky also used like an adjective for big things, mostly animals? Not just fat animals?
Oh okay. today I learnt. Maybe I am wrong too! Who knows for sure nowadays! !
What's the beef? I see what you did there.
Because we are already restricting all non-Singaporeans and PRs from entry. that is technically already a ban.
So instead of having them immediately start contributing to the economy, let's spend on them instead? The current policy of having second gen serve makes the most sense. Only invest in those who have the highest chance of actually staying.
Your original comment reads new citizens, PRs, expats . Second gen new citizens and PRs already have to serve national service, hence I was responding in context of expats. My bad if I wasn't clear.
BAD NEWS there's no vodka (or any alcohol) there. I checked. They do have Kvass though.
I liked the medovik (honey cake, not going to even attempt to type it in Cyrillic letters though)
In such situations, is it appropriate to text 71999 instead of calling 999? Or report on SGSecure? I know it is probably not a terrorist incident, but still, it is an emergency that needs police help.
Maybe I did not notice or maybe it is a newer addition, haven't been there in months. Could be they recently got license to sell.
Right, but I would be scared to actually talk to the police out loud in that situation.
that is literally a nice ish car - I am thinking a Suzuki swift or something.
They did increase call pay for junior doctors as of 1 Jan 2022 but not entirely sure that was covid related. Probably had been in the works for a while
They do not need to attract us with more pay when they can just trap us with a crazy expensive bond
Hope to God that management was kind to the otters
Too many cooks in the kitchen. The person who recorded did the best thing they could, they spread the message of the heroes
No matter what, this kind of elitism is uncalled for. Shows the true colors of the party.
Grab needs to pump up their valuation for US listing - making their owners billionaires at your expense. Better to support local.
cannot see clearly but the man in white shirt was holding a knife?
Is this the one they taught in bmt? Sounds familiar
pension system is now more of just the young funding the old, unless you are referring to a compulsory 401k
What sort of treats would be welcome? I have an upcoming appointment with a team and wondering what sort of food is allowed? Ideally individually wrapped?
, agreed. Same as our society. School - work - build-to-order - work - work - work - die
Does hardbass immediately play when you walk in? Cheeki breeki
felt it ard Bugis. such a weird but surreal way to feel mother nature for the first time the only time I saw or heard of earthquakes were either in the news or back in school.
Ooh I'd love to know more about this? How may I support it? Love seeing singaporeans making waves )
What you mean? They can just as easily see god if they wish to remain unvaccinated. It just takes some time.
do not forget about the cost of renovation which can easily balloon up to around 50k if you add in furnishing and appliances.
How about the covid Heroes that Ministry of Health got some doodler to draw and turns out he copied someone else's work. It was so cringe and there was even a Anti Liverpool FC character if I remember correctly.
Are you telling us with a straight face that it is equally hard for Chinese and Indians to find rentals?
City Harvest Church. We still remember China Wine, but not that the leadership was found guilty and jailed ( http for misappropriating $50 million. Congregation do not give a fuck, church is still going strong and they even own a big piece of Suntec.
Any color allowed as long as it is white rolling on the floor laughing
How about we start to exercise/enforce some social distancing in the trains and buses first with a cross to indicate no seating and by capping the number of passengers onboard in each cabin or bus before protesting -.-
He can be of greater use in a command bunker than alongside us in the field. Perhaps Chan Chun Sing would be because he still national service liable? grinning face with sweat
What a unique name you have there KEY YOUR NAME HERE
Sorry for asking. What is strategic depth in the context of Singapore? Can you kindly eloborate.
Not saying that i've experienced it, but sometimes the grass isn't always greener on the other side. In the end, it narrows down to financial ability.
You never know. He might actually have the chops for a BG slot. But we'll never know because it is never going to come to that.
Stunning. I thought such scenes can only be seen in wide open fields in rural America.
I think posting the link would clear doubts in everyone's minds
not going to lie the greek one looks so chill and relaxing to be in
Yea, that is why i use a Canadian address for my Nintendo account
Yep, been to India in 2018, a typical meal in a university canteen costs about 40-50 rupees. that is about $1 here, includes drink as well.
It makes sense when opposition can promise the people whatever they want to win just like CSJ's policies. Just give the people whatever they want and win.
I am looking at the reviews on Google play store, the reviews are quite bad though. If booking taxi really cheaper than grab car, I wouldn't mind.
Would it be better if the police use taser gun instead? thinking face
I just uninstalled. Some of us do walk the walk.
This guy never learned that just because you have the skill and knowledge to physically hurt someone, does not mean that you should.
i help you find that salesperson and scold them i really will fucking hell storytel eat my ass
http http http Just from a quick good search of just reddit threads you can see it is not a problem that is only specific to Singapore. ( http
You need to learn how to say no. Be firm about your choices. Today it is storytel, tomorrow it could be some insurance agent, another day some shady MLM person. The list goes on. Say no.
Racism. There is no other reason for it. To treat them as other is, and always has been, the true face of this Government.
This is getting ridiculous. We are among the most vaccinated countries in the world, no one in the intensive care unit, and yet we're under some of the strictest measures
that is estradiol though, treating humans with estradiol mainly only occurs with trans people, it is not like cis people take hormones
We have a lot of balancing to do unlike Taliban and piss poor Slavic Baltic states. So it is better hide and do things quietly.
Update The man got arrested ( http Apparently the victim claimed that he was fine ( http and also declined medical assistance.
In NL we're also 1h off and yet we're on top here, so I do not think that necessarily matters?
that is crazy police in the you.s. would have lit him up. Great restraint and control
yes, remember waking up and going to school( polytechnic) and napping throughout the only module for the entire day.
Do cut your hair though Thanks for the reminder!
Yea man. We are quite close to the 200th intake. The last time I went back for range, I was shooting beside a bunch of 16X batch. I am from the early 13X batch.
I say this from a scientific research point of view. does anyone have data on the higher-risk complications of unvaxx?
At this point it is just to make the economist happy, but I still do not get why a reduced birth rate is a bad thing, it is not like we're strapped for workers
I mean, those pesky relationship could make you stray from studying, what happens if your precious grade drops Or gasp what happen if you get depressed if you break up ? Won't that bring down your grades even more? I am being sarcastic
Ya like how. Realistically, there's no way to do so. you saying need to hold our Government to task, is you just comforting urself
Watch how straits times paint how the killer loves to play sticks and stones on cod
please go do research, if UTI is left untreated it can lead to kidney failure
Can I ask who runs the workshop/whether they're still running it?
Ong Ye Kung was new at that time though. Now to be an anchor minister and lose? that is horrible.
For a moment I thought it was one of the super old MRT train, where their white slowly changed to yellow
He is using a ipad though. Vanced is not available for ios
I think this is the first time I see a slashing incident happening in school, it is always outside the school
too late. One is heading to UN right now with a measuring tape
Awesome! Dumped Grab long ago due to its sneaky money grabbing ways
The number of sian has multiplied by infinity. For the f&b it is instead the saltmines all activated at once.
Jamie's jawline is too strong, lord farquaad has prevailed. But we will be back.
Then later we see the white flag over us again.
Honestly I'll have asked the religious dude to just fuck off. We in 2022 not 1922. I really hate those people who goes around preaching to strangers. The mosque exists for a reason
No, he made it to Malaysia and was captured there
I cannot get over the fact this his middle name is Jerome.
Felt it in tanah merah. I thought my chair was possessed.
this is exactly why the cpf scheme is flawed - you cannot have a scheme that deals with both retirement and housing needs.
Serious question does no dining in mean we can still takeaway the food and have a picnic style meal outside.?
Or gay, or foreigner, or dark skinned ( it is not just Indians who get issues)
Not gona lie, I jizzed in my pants a little.
but to generalize the rule to a whole country with over a billion fucking people is lazy and bigoted. Not sure if serious or just.dare I say, lazy ?
But why go through the potential hassle of litigation + refurbishing when you can avoid it altogether?
Shocking. rest in peace, kid. I hope the killer is caught and brought to justice.
the mental image of me yeeting my parents into the vaccination centre cracked me up
Working from home will once again be the default for workplaces , and employers have to ensure that staff who can work from home do so. This one most redditors welcome
Imagine years from now telling your kids your claim to fame is a middle finger on national day
If their definition of peaceful involves devolving to Syria-style civilian shelling like what happened to kharkiv then yes they're definitely doing their best now
. that is still considered racist right? that is like a Singapore Chinese discriminating PRC Chinese.
Oh! that is Doug, his cool. Tell him I say hi
Older than you by a decade but exactly how I feel. The power imbalance is ridiculous.
The VACCINATION syringe is just a DISTRACTION to make our population DOCILE. They are just using the syringe to make us OBEDIENT and STUPID!
The sad thing is the bullies will get away scot-free and the bullied who over reacted will be forever condemned.
Welcome to Singapore, the toxicity is worst when you go university OP. people start comparing grades and which prestigious internships or CCA positions you have. But that is life - eat or be eaten.
What was the price of the vodkas? Prices for liquor seem to be so random in Singapore.
This meme would have been better if it was a comparison between 2016 and 2022 where the mainstream meaning of catching it has shifted from PoGo to covid. .
You are right. I just felt upset that he insinuated I was dumb was the reason I was working retail at that point of time.
Working full time and earning well for my age. I actually replied what I was earlier but deleted deciding that since my user is my realname and if I revealed my work area, my privacy would be gone. Heh
The elitist schools only exist for people who has money not the capacity to being smart. A lot of people can succeed going a mediocre school.
Can just give it here! Good feedback, bad feedback, all also can. No worries )
eh.I say support it if you think it is a good game la, but thanks anyway!
I started alone but now I am not. I have two people helping me, though I do not know if they want to be named !
If you are having trouble with firing and walking Shift + Click hold position and attack Alt + Click hold fire and move We're working on a tutorial to explain this. The glyphs as well )
Nope I do not want my game to be not safe for work game. Sorry (
Not released yet.but can play the demo on Steam! ( http )
Sadly no, there will not be multiplayer for the demo but we are hoping to get couch co-op out sometime this year
Thanks for the feedback! We really have to do something about movement, a lot of the things you mentioned were discussed internally
Thanks for this! Yeah, we've had a lot of people say they inventory management is clunky right now. We gotta think of how to fix this (IhateUI/ user experience)
Thanks! I hope so, there has been a number of youtubers who have covered the game
Yeah, we've managed to work something out. Everyone is going to be compensated fairly for their contributions
Yes, it'll be on Steam ) See this comment ( http here
You can try the demo now actually! The Steam Fest runs from 21st Feb to 28 Feb, so the demo will be available throughout that period as well )
The opposite sex implies there's a main sex in a duopoly of sexes. nice!
Much better to have leaders that do not lead the country into a crisis in the first place.
Exactly. Anyone suggesting a 70 year should be going to war is an idiot. The point is would the leaders of Singapore have the balls to do it?!
So easy to scam people in Singapore. So many people so oblivious to being taken advantage of.
So sorry. Very sympathetic to all of you just trying to celebrate a joyous occasion in your life and having to deal with all of this.
It does but nothing like the 30+ million doses administered. Many come from the EU and India.
ALEXA PLAY ASTRONOMIA. But in all seriousness, they'll probably get a cushy job at some government-linked company.
At least give a longer warning period? How is 1 day sufficient what the fuck
I can appreciate his ability to make so much money with so little effort.
Import more you clowns. We had this under control and for what? Everything is becoming undone now.
Well great news - the aggressor has been arrested and the victim appears fine http
I would say public image should be HC is probably better than ACS academically, so not really 3, but ACS culture breeds a different kind Hwachong is academically better than ACS. It isn't a public image, its a fact.
not big brother . This is civil servant mentality. Emergency is not defined so naturally adopt the most narrow meaning to cover backside.
Has the full on Sharia mode been implemented? Have you guys started stoning gays already? And what do young Bruneians think of it? Seems like your sultan's idea of post oil plan is to double down on Arabisation
I probably only touch fast food of any kind once every few months. It does gross you out after not eating grease for a while. That said lots of our hawker food isn't that healthy either.
Junior doctors quitting residency is because staying in public healthcare with no guarantee of Associate Con position is a raw deal, and not necessarily because of the current strain, no? They can earn more outside with the private medical groups.
people leaving religion and realizing that skydaddy is fictional, trigger you?
isn't it just 1? NCM? Lam Pin Min is just an SMS and Amrin is a PS. edit p.s. change to past tense

No wonder civil service care so much about ur academic achievements. After so many years still cannot get over which school someone else went to
I know a couple of people in your situation too, unable to get vaccine either from.allergy or from having covid. It absolutely sucks and I am pissed off that you are affected because of this.
We should turn off the staff's Safe Entry so they cannot go anywhere. Personal sanctions!
In this sub i always hear people say oh not many serious cases so lets open up fully! Anyone who suggests caution gets downvoted to oblivion and scolded. Look, this is basically what you want.
Holy shit. It literally happened a few hours ago. Rest in peace.
Still, it is madness. I'll wait for more conclusive investigations by the SPF, hopefully in the evening. Meanwhile, all we can do is to give our condolences to the deceased.
Just vote them out already. The leadership is morally bankrupt and too comfortable.
Oooooof, and my mom always tells me to watch my own behavior all the time. And not offend people in public. Even Mr. Balakrishnan cannot help but let emotions get the better of him.
They also own the cars. Grab does not have anything concrete. If good engineers and right culture go to comfort it should easily beat Grab.
Russian Embassy should leave if not happy. Actions speak louder than words.
cannot say for all, but some already sent their sons away to skip ns
Totally agree, for every young couple worried about build-to-order prices, there are 5 other homeowners worried about a cooling property market. Affordable housing isn't politically viable.
I would like to ask a simple question. What situation are you talking about? It is a very simple question, because I am very confused by the question asked concerning the situation. Mr Speaker Yes, I am also very confused.
Hopefully you have some sheng siong stocks in your portfolio
Makes sense. I did not choose to be born here, I have no loyalty towards this country. The ones who lead this country on the other hand, chose to do so and that comes with certain expectations.
Weak argument. But in any case there's a huge difference between renting an apartment and governing a country.
Imagine calling subreddit of singapore Government bootlickers when it is well known to be the most anti- Government Singaporean forum out there. laughing my fucking ass off
It absolutely is though. Cumulatively, we are missing out on 4 hours of rest each week and over 1 week and 1 day of rest each year compared to the countries around the 8h sleep mark.
Just bench and a set of dumbbells are no match for actual squats and deadlifts with a barbell. Sorry
Off by 1 hour actually, our Local Mean Time is around GMT+7
brother I am still going back to office. so not really circuit breaker.
From May 16 - so. tonight and tomorrow are going to be jam-packed with people dining out, huh?
To be fair I read in some of the comments of the video being more so of them opened bloated cans, which is indicative of it being spoiled.
Thank you for the smile you've put on my face!
Same with Filipino lo-fi girl, but with a belt or slipper instead of cane and more human rights abuses .
but then again, if HSK did not head over there, they could had lost another group representation constituency. Hard to imagine who else they could had deployed there that could match Nicole, while also not causing turbulence in the party.
Eh wanna turn this into a poster or post card?
we asked encik what if the guy charges towards you before you fire the warning shot. he said shoot that bugga first then fire off your warning shot.
I would be too traumatised to teach if something like that happened in my school
Eh, you'll be fine. singapore is still statistically very safe. These are just unfortunate freak accidents.
Singaporeans also has the worses uses of English in the world.
They better sell mopc, that drink is the best drink ever. IYKYK. If you do not google it.
a good economy means more foreign money coming in, and by keeping their money here we keep their vested interest as well. if we let them take their money elsewhere we have no hostages
an attacking country will never be as motivated as a defending one, esp when most of the troops are like yeah but why are we going in? cannot we leave them alone?
i have a friend who has a house there, belonged to his grandfather till this day

Ministry of Health did well in brainwashing the masses with their vaccination narrative. Even reddit is affected. Kudos
it is amazing how you equate 5 people protesting peacefully to riots in the US ignited by far right and far left ideologies
. 5 people protesting peacefully outside a building is a threat to stability. Ok.
do it! I would go to an photo exhibition featuring that
I liked that one of the old uncle first question was about the school. he really does observe things differently.
someone should start a photo series of covid restricted prohibited objects
Sounds like a horrible place to live! Move to the Nordic countries or northern Europe. Work / life balance is high on our agenda.
I need more international news summary's in the form of The Office gifs. Please and thank you.
The amount of lead time to 8 May is just ridiculous, haven't we learned that Singaporeans overreact and overcompensate when given lead time? Expect gyms to be a clusterfuck from now till Saturday.

he is just going to retire next GE if we're being honest
Thanks for the clarification, I wasn't very much aware of these points.
Rookie numbers here in the States, all three cops would have unloaded their mags into that dude.
There is always difficult people around. people who think differently. Is not the country, society, company or environment that is difficult. The people within is the key. Change school, change company. The people remain the same.
Birth rates are declining in most of the developed countries. Places like Australia would have a shrinking population if not for migration.
The key is not to make eye contact. Just pretend they do not exist.
The response should be at workplace boss is paying my salary, so i listen to him. In school my parents are paying your salary, so you listen to what my parents say.
That never happened. If anything Trumped did not do it soon enough. Remember he did not want to shut down the US Economy.
40? I realised everything only goes downhill when I was 16.
MSM won't be publishing this, so the damage would be limited.
Only 8 people can send use this template but not with that figure
Hi, in case you were not aware patients with mild allergic reactions like rash only etc are now allowed to take the vax
This is so funny because the left claims to be for science but that all goes out the window when they start talking about biological differences between the sexes.
Spot on. it is crazy to continue to make decisions based on the impact the disease might have on a small a section of the population who have CHOSEN not to get on board with the vaccination plans.
I agree. It is not racism. it is a Government making a decision that protects the lives, health, and long term economic outlook for the people who voted them in and pay tax to them
Precisely! And countries that have functioning economy won't risk opening their border with us if we do not have our shit together. How is that good for economy?
Well, at least we are not racist. So there's that
You see? You see how bad things can go when ministers no longer cry in parliament and citizens no longer sing and clap near their window?

Please do not do that. Voting is our right, exercise it. You may dislike both but there will definitely be some reason to pick one over the other however weak that reason may be.
His son was in my ethics class which covered the scandal in one of the lesson. Needless to say he skipped class that day
How long ago was this? I enlisted almost 20 years ago and remembered going for pre enlisting heart screening
what the fuck. You just coveniently ignored the 200,000 of us overseas for work and none-leisure reasons.
Does it mean now they cannot? How will they stop unvaccinated people from eating at hawker centers?

where the fuck do you get that view in Romania? Alba Iulia?
A very important question to ask yourself now is this. Is having kids and starting a family a goal of yours, or something that has been ingrained into your thinking by society and family.
well that would solve the problem of 1 parent bringing siblings to school (so 2 people travelling together). but month-long term break is coming a couple of weeks anyway.
Doctoranywhere. Raffle connect. Work great for VC doctors. You can get a doctor in 5 mins.
Right? Seems strange. He may have just been locked in flight mode, and just wanted to get as far away as soon as possible.
I thought part 3 was pretty good Part 4 is indefensible
Probably going to be downvoted but yeah. In exchange for 'freedom' we get safety and stability which is better for the population as a whole
CNA's documentary Days of Disaster which includes SQ117 and Hotel New World is actually on Netflix. Worth a watch.
I am not Muslim but my mother is (my dad did not convert when they got married) and I have also faced isolation and ostracisation from some who find out about my background.
Panic buying at supermarkets makes no sense either, but it is happening
Stop harassing people who are trying to do honest work and make a living.
Tell them you subscribed before and cancelled because you feel that it is not for you.
that is quite long ago (1991) wasn't it? Mbs was mentioned above. Or was there a more recent one?
. I live here too but I did not feel anything - 4th floor
sigh. The parents will never be able to heal, losing a child is like a gaping hole in the heart. the hole may get smaller, but it will always be there. this whole thing is so shocking.

it is not OC, just sharing funny memes but it probably got viral from here
! Anybody use staycation for catching a few winks before 2020? The soft comforter and 18 degrees temperature without noise pollution(kids at pool). Money well spent!
! I am sure most religions started as a coping mechanism for the living as we all know life sucks but if a religion is also sucking out your life then maybe we do not need it?
! Who knew people would use culture & religion to control people
Oic, possibly the temperature? I would wake up earlier when it is 2 degrees too hot or too cold but if it is just nice, confirm oversleep! !
Sidenote Pelmeni is delicious! There's vegetarian, salmon, duck, chicken or cheese like ravioli! Unfortunately the Russian dumplings restaurant is pretty expensive for me but I love to try it at least once on my birthday
So sorry to hear this is happening to your school, glad to hear you are safe now What an ordeal, just know we here for you.
So true, our tired minds are filled with worries that no amount of work can solves. And I literally dreamt of work, and the worst part is I still have to do the work (again) in the morning!
Spain is testing the 3 days weekend and imagine that in singapore! We can sleep for 2.5days, and still got time to bring the dogs out!
Wind Sounds of the whipping cane kept me weeping too
With so many news of road accidents, I am also guessing is mainly due to lack of sleep. Not causation but correlation.
Yeah I am wondering if he got a death wish, running towards armed officers outside a police station.
Yeah man, imagine being straight is queer & unhealthy then the feeling of being the outsider would be depressing & lonely to me too.
Yeah man, screen addiction is the next pandemic, oh wait
It went from protect those who are immunocompromised to alienate them real quick
calling it unhealthy Those that partake in gay sex have a 4000% greater chance to die from anal cancer. Is reality homophobic?

The accuracy tho. I wouldnt like to stereotype, but at this point it really be like that a lot. Heck.
So are gyms closed? Or will they implement a mask on policy. I really hope it is the latter /

For police to arrest, without video evidence, they Need a valuable arrestable offence. This video is meant for courts. The lockup will deal with him first. Then courts and hopefully prison
If it goes to that state where we are seeing our 70 year old ministers fighting a battle in a shellscrape. Well we're fucked. that is how bad the situation has become
Wait wait. Isn't it Verbal command unarmed tactics taser/baton then firearm subject to ROJ

Grab gives off evil vibes now but remember when CDL was the arrogant rich boomer that couldn't care less about its service model. Bottomline competition is good, monopolies are bad.

For a professor at a French business school, I half-expected him to say do not give the People's Action Party carte blanche! But yah , he played it well.
Do they announce each day where the cases had travelled from and their quarantine? I did not think they did. Though for some they seem to, like the university student.
I am glad we have time to adjust at work. Hated the previous practice of these evening announcements that took effect immediately. Now I can chill and sort it tomorrow.
You mean do not play armchair analyst with 20-20 hindsight six months from now? Where's the fun in that? I am being sarcastic
Did the security guards check whether they are residents before allowing entry?
Definitely not the antivaxxer because they cannot even come out to rally
Agree. Everyone else trying to bring across this point was downvoted to hell.
Dumb move, knowing that protests are illegal in Singapore. They knew what they were in for. face with rolling eyes
Agree with this so much. Do a snap Circuit Breaker NOW!! Economic impact will be less than the drawn out slow decay and death.
Because Indian Singaporeans are seen as not real Singaporeans, despite being citizens. edit to be clear, this isn't my belief. it is what I've seen.

The karaoke lounges cluster is under control. The escalation is from the Jurong Fishery Port. The virus likely came in through the port. The wet market cluster is still growing. http
There's shortage of homes and prices have gone up across the board
Definitely felt that, asked in group chat and none of my friends felt that. Then found Earthquake info.
If our Government is as proactive as providing support to those with psychiatric issues (and by extension this) as they are arresting protesters, I think Ministry of Education wouldn't have such issues and need not issue deflections.
Well with the track record of our Government in relation to protesters I wouldn't have high hopes
When I am alone outside, normally I walk very fast so no one has a chance to talk to me.
Just curious and more of doing a fact-check why is the health worker keeping his distance (from the author and even his own family)? Suppose if he really does have the virus, can it even be spread like this?
brother kids probably pee in the pool all the time. No one say anything.
Wrong direction for that. Offshore live firing is done on the southern side of Singapore.
I pity people with allergies to the vaccines. They want to get vaccinated but cannot. So now they are stuck.

Even if the recommendation was different the teacher will still use their values and enforce their views.
If a sales person approaches you do not stop walking, just walk walk walk and sooner or later they will give up.
Ok, but why the 99% good people do not react to racism? If they'd taken a simple step of telling their peer that is really not cool it could make a world of difference.
She tied the umbrella to the stick, no need to be so prickly
Same here. Supposed to be our first long vacation this year. Really disappointed because this could have been avoided.
Hey brother you go up first I join you later. And then I proceed to never go up.
Can we please send this video to the cops in the US? They seem to think that one shot isn't enough to stop knife-wielding assailants (or car key-holding).
he is got a baby face + broad shoulders. Modern day auntie sha shou. Excuse my hanyupinyin. I do not know whether I spelled it correctly.
OP in the future just say no thanks, I am busy. and keep walking
you are correct. Roughly 1.1 million dollars with up to 6 months bonus + 13th month
Okay, that is just fucking cruel. Why would you wake up this woman who just suffered a fucking heart attack? Let her rest, goddammit. No Grade is worth endangering a life.

Asking the real questions. 2 seems a really weird number that is going to add a lot of stress to familes.
What is going on? Maybe working from home I am following the new more closely but I cannot remember ever seeing so many murders, let alone in such a short time span. I am in total shock. rest in peace little man.
he is not stupid. He knows there are enough fools who'd part with their money.
2 senior engineers at my dad's company have decided to resign and go back home after this news. Good luck boys. Beginning of the end. If anyone has any questions about moving to Europe/America, I can answer them.
At a certain point when you have 70% first dose and almost 50% second dose, and have no reopening plans whatsoever, people are going to question the leadership and longterm future of the country.
Lots of people are already leaving. My dad and mum are leaving at the end of the year, and almost all the movers are so packed, they're raising rates. You should at least start looking for a job at home.
Dear Sengkang, Aljunied and Hougang, people You guys are my hero!!

http VCH, on its own, is a non-arrestable offence.if you are a victim of VCH and you wish to pursue the matter, you will have to file a Magistrate's Complaint to the court.
Filming is very important. It is the other onlookers that are actually not doing anything to contribute help.
It is just the way our laws were designed. Not the police fault.
Median may be 4.5k but I wonder what is the mode too.
I do not think i need to explain why, Please do, from first principles.
Can you explain how any individual rights are being taken away in this instance?
Until 18, parents can be pressured by the law and associated Government bodies to continue to take care of their child
I wonder how a no blacks rental tag would go over in the us.
So that they can have the privilege of serving this great nation if they are male
do not think anyone is condemning the police for following procedure, but condemning the restriction of freedom of speech and assembly in Singapore generally.
If they are not inside my private property, harassing people or creating a public nuisance, why should I be able to remove people using a public space?
people who feel like shit (e.g. treated like shit at work) treat other people like shit. Basically taking out their frustration on those they feel superior to.
that is a very Singaporean mindset to have. Most countries do not have such limits on the use of public space. Also, how are 5 people holding up signs disturbing the peace?
Not a lawyer, but I am sure waterboarding children and breaking their fingers is illegal.
this is epic! Creative and reflects the current situation too. Good job!
i do not understand this chart - the total bars do not add up to 100%. so this is a percentage of cases who died in this timeframe against total deaths throughout the pandemic?
we need to remain pro-business and pro-workers at the same time!
Oh yes, thank you for this video and giving them exposure. I really like their channel and if you want to support them, please donate to their patron!
Service for the country cannot be measured in dollars and cents pui
LOYALTY TO COUNTRY!!!!! Eh sia I read already almost wanted to shout LOYALTY TO COUNTRY!!!!! LEADERSHIP!!!!! DISCIPLINE!!!!! PROFESSIONALISM!!!!! FIGHTING SPIRIT!!!!! ETHICS!!!!! CAAAAAARE FOR SOLDIERSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Parents usually nag at us saying, oh who is going to take care of you when you are older? sia , my dad literally said that to me after dinner two days ago
Eh, kinda obvious that they only put safety at the end just because way too many NSFs died than is necessary
Idea . Next time just answer, We can get you the numbers. But let me say this. What is the point behind the question?
Or the people stationed outside the malls. Oi oi oi, no TraceTogether no vaccination status no going in!
This is home, really, everything's about money Pay for car, house, university Where our bank loans always grow
You try post that and let us know their replies?
They banned the sale of chewing gum, not the act of chewing the gum itself.
Alerts the system. Intercom goes on and you can describe the situation
I've resigned for less. I hate employers that have zero trust and is always suspicious that their employees are slacking off. If you do not trust me, then it is time to leave.
it is actually very sad. I do not think their economy is doing very well, the people are suffering but those on top do not care enough
serious question here! how about those who cannot get vaccinated due to medical reasons? 0
I heard the Bishan gang is rather.gangsters . Hope to see more of your drawings on Singapore! Do you have an Instagram page ?
No worries! Your artworks are amazing! Keep doing what you are doing )
Seeing all these comments about being in primary school in 2017 makes me feel really old
As an admirer of the creative energies of hindenburg, i am offended. J neo couldn't punch himself out of a wet paperbag.
Board members are still allocated a few 'preferential' seats for students they deem 'worthy', should they choose to exercise it. White horse culture simply does not disappear because the proletariat make noises.
In ns? Some of us have to live with this our entire careers. Boss gathers the ri/rgs/rjc posse and everyone else is an outsider.
Or decency. No decent person would sit in that chamber and go along with half the policies that are being rolled out without arguments.
We really are tiny specks of dust on this great piece of rock
Just because they did not mean to does not mean it does not affect other people. They are still required to be held accountable for their actions and word that hurt people, because at the end of the day, they did hurt people.
Break up with her brother she must become your wife
brother thinks a taser will stop a drunk man with a knife skull
keeping it illegal will only force people to do things via the back door.
Exactly. What kind of stupid question is this even? Besides, actually fighting physically is not the only contribution during wartime. Different people can have different strengths to contribute
A bit sad that my MP from woodlands, Amrin Amin, had to go Seng Kang and lose. If he just stayed here it'll be fine. Pretty nice guy.
Almost got a panic attack seeing this video. I do not want go war la fuck
As our very own wise sage Calvin Cheng once said, Let the flood gates open I am being sarcastic
That guy is from my school . Kranji Secondary, to be precise. I remember my DM making a fuss regarding someone who wasn't behaving during the parade.
This is true. The diamond ring is expensive and worthless (if you intend to sell it). My wife seldom even wear it.
This was precisely what I observed that prompted me to minimise my wedding guest list. Big wedding is suppose to be for rich people.
Very true. I kinda feel that the internet is not helping either. It render easier exposure to the ever, rapid changing trends.
We will still be Ukraine. In the event our neighbours amass their troops near the borders, like Russia did, we are likely to strike than to wait for them to come in.
Wedding suppose to be an intimate event. However, it somehow evolve to a thing. Hotel banquet, long quest list and fancy program.
No worries mate, see you on the front page when it blows up
You can present /interpret data in many ways. Proportion who died 1x vaccinated Proportion unvaccinated (0) 20+10+4+6 60 So 40% died with at least 1 vac, and 60% died fully unvaxxed. Is this interpretation correct?
Based on respect for the values and beliefs of the various ethnic and religious communities If the values and beliefs of your community involve homophobia, it does not deserve to be respected.
If Jamus teaches in my class, I would stay woke all the way
likewise. a family member thought it was the NSC works and called TC to complain
TC actually called back about 10mins later and informed fam member that tremors were due an earthquake. By then I had already informed everyone. We just -ed together.
Can almost hear the CDG PR apparatus creakily get into gear after decades of nonuse.
do not worry every school a good school. Especially when it is not their own kids' schools (ri, acs)
As if security deposits do not exist to handle the very same reason given to not rent.
It should be factored into the security deposit. No reason not to rent to people cooking curry.
There's a very large number of things you cannot legally do with your property. The idea that if you own something you can do whatever you want with it is false.
We all know what comes next, this reddit thread http
You know many cases where the vaccine caused death? But Ministry of Health refuses to acknowledge it? So. How did you heard about them? From which social network starting with F do you get your information?
Gone are the days when journalists could ask Lee Kuan Yew his thoughts on an issue and we'd get a clear, definitive answer, even if we did not like it.
But was he suspicious tho Seemed pretty blatant and obvious in his intents, not shifty at all
All schools in Singapore are good schools, but some are plusgood and and a few are doubleplusgood.
For the clicks. Even CNA needs to make money, no?
he is a arty officer. Give him a pair of binos and a radio.
How the SAF did not use to screen for heart problems before enlistment and accepted that a few people will simply drop dead once in a while.
I remember once they tasered a chopper wielding somewhat older woman and she was up and yelling at them after a minute or so.
It started around the time I operationally ready date, so yes, slightly less then 20 years ago. edit oh fuck, I am old
nope, my own. just came up with it. was fairly easy to more or less match the number of syllables in our pledge.
OK, all of you , I do not want to hear any of you complaining that Singapore got too many migrants in the future.
Perhaps the vaccine was a factor. Means more get it without symptoms but pass it on. Means hidden cases only now caught by testing.
As if anyone has nothing better to do but spy on small unimportant fry like him with no brains to pick
Looking forward to the new Netflix movie - Sleepless in Singapore
Already say is with respect to religious and ethnic groups in Singapore ok. do not need be so caught up with the word equality when they already put a qualifier at the end.
Gay Singaporean boys are second in oppression only to non-chinese gay Singaporean boys.
Go there for what. Go protest india embassy or MFA .
Can confirm. A friend of mine(Indian,born in Singapore) do not like Indians from India.
frogman was good. It gives a glimpse of life in Navy for those who did not get into navy at least. I watched frogman on the day it was released. Watched with my cousins. Really enjoyed it.
If I am not wrong, dogs can be owned for hunting purposes or tracking purposes.
Same I thought its just some school showing the importance of education in Singapore or smtg like that something new today I learnt!
They are liberal and they do not care about your race or religion in general.
Exactly. At worst, maybe probation. Even for Amos's case last time, they did not even want to jail him. Offered him options like probation but he did not want to take it.
Except we haven't opened up. We have been at 5 pax for months. So how?
Gotta show all those crowded places to highlight how Singaporeans aren't taking measures seriously
Gotta put up an act and imply that locals are to blame. When it comes to borders, zero peep from them.
Like our dear friends who always say think of the healthcare worker being overwhelmed by covid, we need restrictions . Then you ask if can improve their working conditions, pay etc., all diam diam.
Locals do not want to be nurses because our Government has never made nursing attractive for people.
Not election season, nobody is going to take accountability. If it is election season, the tears will come out, the apologies will flow freely.
Same here. Secured a job but waiting for paperwork. Hoping it does not happen to us but have to be prepared.
Sounds like this is echoing the structural problems that healthcare had been facing for many many years which basically boils down to poor management, toxic working conditions and lack of remuneration.
We had our previous outbreak with JEM, Bukit Merah etc. How many ended up in intensive care unit? people keep on harping about hypotheticals rather than looking at actual data.
Does Singapore realize they do not have the money to fund this kind of shit imagine spending money enforcing this with all that is happening in the country.
Nice to hear that. Good stuff really send a good message
Congratulations for getting conscripted Good job brother You very strong soldier
Wait when we banned flights from UK because of the new strains, no one complained , we aint being racist, we do not want to have a large influx of imported cases which will overwhelm our healthcare system.
See, in Malaysia there are Chinese Malays, Indian Malays and Malay Malays
colleagues If they pronounce this curr-league they're already cut off from my life anyway
I read a comment somewhere yesterday They elected a fool and got a president. Other countries elect presidents and get fools.
Whoever taught us to pronounce flour as flahhh has a lot to answer for. (This includes Malaysians as well)
Felt it in Serangoon. Thought I am imagining things, then I search Google and found there's earthquake at Indonesia.
Just need to enforce vaccination for Toto and all kopitiams serving beer. Then watch vaccination rates soar
Triple upvote for you sir. Upvoted your posts from subreddit of malaysia and subreddit of indonesia because you deserve it
honestly I do not think it had ever been used apart from the FB video introducing the concept of the safety stoppage card.
. I support the People's Action Party Government / they are my masters
how dare he do such a thing tsk tsk tsk
The handle reminds me of when my mom let me choose which colour I wanted.
Because they just need a single reason to arrest them and then can pile on charges later.
For the ba $rd mother sons of b s over there, they serve the Cevapi. We serve the Kebapi.
Considering how control is a huge part of abrahamic religions, the forceful approach is a viscious cycle by design really and there are definitely some out there who are in it for the daily power trips.
Imagine getting offended by someone drinking water to quench their thirst, all while having faith in their so-called omnipotent deity. Shows how fragile the foundations really are but in come the mental gymnastics and special pleading.
It is really disgusting how people will put an imaginary deity with no concrete proof of existing over their own tangible children in this one life they and their children will ever have.
Minority? Maybe in countries with mostly secular rule, but then there's literal theocracies that exist where its citizens face punishment or even death for criticising or doubting the religion at all.
There really shouldn't be any religious law or courts in a secular society in my opinion. Both freedom of religion and freedom from religion are important, but most importantly religion should have no say in politics and policy making.
You do realise that the former still demands death of apostates and in some cases non-believers right? What does that tell you?
You say that but religious indoctrination in families and theocractic rule in many countries continue to exist. Then there's the example of the Government pandering to religious snowflakes by censoring media and outright banning movies/cartoons/performances.
Stop using the whitening creams. that is terrible for your skin in the longer run.
did not talent spot a guy who was on MSN as an analyst for the economy ( http and scouted someone like Ivan instead. Good job.
they just achieved the impossible, if she wasn't on the verge of crying in joy that'll be weird. So happy for SK , everything backfired so badly
not going to lie, i am pretty impressive by how some people can study for 12 hours+ with short breaks in between sia
Where is ur manager? I wan to speak with him!
not to mention how ec and wc almost lost too )
Absolutely amazing how she made it this far.She defiantly does not deserve any hate
I stopped donating money because of this Rather give it to someone i know
Do we want to ban Singapore citizens and PR from returning? Tell me if the sub say yes.
I think there are some schoolgirls that stream themselves studying on YouTube/Twitch
If the sub wants this, better say it this way
Should we ban Singapore citizens/PR from returning from India too?
So it seems like the sub is okay with risking the life of a Singaporean overseas. Even when if they come back they get 21 day quarantine
I do not think it is a Singapore thing exclusively. I mean, what's the point of it all? he who has a why to live can figure out a how
damn i laughed for a straight minute as a fellow POE player.
Worked in a local sme, boss was a super proud ACS boy, self made millionair and all. Everyday hear him talk shit about RI
After this campaign, please make sure to volunteer for Opposition parties if you want to. Politics is not about the 9 days, it is about the 5 years.
Basically most sinkies Have Chinese name but can speak compo Chinese only
even china has protests being in the same group as north korea is not a good look
gd some people here are either dense/malicious/stupid or all of the above
Having those people in Parliament will be really entertaining. Now imagine 40-50 of them.
I wonder if the WP is a coalition of Teochew supporters + young liberal people
it has always been like that , they just got worse at hiding it the pap has always been populist and right-wing, they've just gotten worse at masking it

MASSIVE L TO DE MASSIVE THROBBING COCK EGOS OF Chan Chun Sing AND THE CHAO CBS OF THE 4G LEADERSHIP MASSIVE L rest in peace CCBS DESERVER FUCK People's Action Party so this is what facebook comments look like ?
Raeesah smear actually backfired on them Anyway I actually feel like social media could swing marginal races like with Sengkang group representation constituency
Seriously tho, do they have anything else other than being a check and balance?
Good job ! Thank you for sharing your art .
Plot twist. the Ukrainian rep was planting a bug on the guy
Tldr Serve national service. Go for ICT. Pass ippt. do not complain.
Who say poorly motivated . All the ICT surveys say otherwise! I am being sarcastic in case anyone cannot see it.
Is this old post? I thought Ong Ye Kung is the health minister
Yeah man, I am all for this to be honest. A lot of auntie and uncles as well as anti vacc folks not wanting to do it because of some quack science.
Sorry, I do not quite understand your first question. with respect to drugs, depends on the drug to be honest but some of them really do cause a lot of harm to others (directly, not just as a 'drain on society').
When I see a fight I am mostly like 'fair enough', until the start stomping or kicking people in the head whilst they're on the floor - that is the sign of a real asshole.
They get their commission only after you signed up, they have to take photo of my subscribed account (yeah I gave my CC to subscribe)
Imagine being such a worthless piece of shit that you cannot simply move past a conversation without expressing your anger through violence. Just screams insecurity.
Shame is the only thing these assholes understand. Leak it to world press and let the fun begin.
Still salty after the RI/ACS only girls got their action.
Working foodpanda during summer break I am going to make a killing wooohoooo
So am I. It has nothing to do with the race of people and everything to do with the amount of covid cases.
Just out of curiosity who do you think the municipal authority professionals should report to? Self regulated? TC, MP, HDB, you as a resident? Resident committee?
There is a big difference in banning flights before something has spread (containment) and banning flights six months after its been in the you.S.

I am an Indian and I do not find this racist at all
I do not think Halimah Yacob will be very useful inside a shellscrape.
Amazing how the first 18 years of ones life is just You study.
Based on social stigma, yes. An employer is probably not going to hire a convicted murderer (then again, social stigma, it might change)
Not necessarily a bad thing. hushed face -Koh '2 Car' Poon -36.23? Why not -100? Apparently still NOT hungry enough. -Delame Lim
Elson Delane Lim Lee, flounder and chief dulce-bag exeggutor of an student recruitment anti-employee's basic welfare company, said he insists on seeing an MC to verify an employee's claim that he is covid positive. hungryMCeyepower I am being sarcastic?
My dad and mom still say this lo While their own faces are also glued to the phone I bet! Double-standard.
On the bright side, at least he did not use his own milk.YET
Biggest nation's little sister ever. South Korea's little sisters got nothing on our Sengkang mei mei.
Just track down their email address, usually can find via FB or googling their name. Mine is a minister and I noticed he is more responsive to emails to his ministry address, so I send there.
Or Indonesian/Malaysian palm oil companies. There's lots of former top SAF folks in that space.
I was just reading the CNA comment section and my god I did not know Singapore had that much stupid people.
Or the whole vaccine is a plot by Government to control their people
that is going to be listed in my nft collection. Starting price 50 eth.
All lot of the money spent on NDP has already been spent on things like labour, rehearsals, etc.
Not sure if they still have them because I ate there a long while ago, but their pickled fish is also really good.
My uncle owns a hunting dog in malaysia, he just cuts the part where the dog bites
I've only been there on a few one-week stays but the 12-hours-light 12-hours-dark is pretty interested because Singapore's just above the equator.
Be kind to one another. You'll never know if your one random act of kindness to someone might divert them back to a safer path.
I am not healthcare related, so are my family members but we all received it through sms and email.
I see a target for the Bayraktar TB2 drone. Please say cheese to the camera
Acceptable when Biden does it for pandemic. Unacceptable when Trump does it for excessive terrorism from Muslim radicals.
oh my god this. I really appreciate Government for controlling the pandemic but they really enforce the measures a little too late everytime like banning people from India from entering.
Adobe Photoshop software is banned for export to North Korea among others, if I remember correctly
And across Asia, only Singapore, Japan and South Korea among the 80 states co-sponsored the resolution, from what I read
And he still ran a white shoe firm in Asia
Both of which are still relevant to defending our sovereignty and territorial integrity, in a sense. do not think some NATO members signed the land mine conventions either.
Exceptions must be made for medically ineligible and children, no two ways about it, if you want to appear fair.
Fair enough, but a temporary scale could be applied to determine what level of movement is appropriate for infection control purposes, without shutting the inflow altogether.
He should not have been at the frontline. Also, do we equip our inbound traveller ICA folks in full personal protective equipment, N95, gowns and shield? Our Muslim friends and their Hari Raya (
I hope the folks who left the train did tell the staff that there is an assault in the train
I think so far, only Singapore and SK Eagles are more advanced than USAF line aircraft. The Japanese 15Js are close after their upgrade. Oh right, the Israeli Ra'am variant too.
If you have no dining-in, why have a limit on households heading out. Makes no sense, this one. Some folks may need more than two for medical appointments e.g, one to drive, another to accompany the other elderly parent/s.
If you listen to it all, it does sounds like typical uncles ribbing.
It can be done smoother if they open up all entrances, and station someone. it is ludicrous to keep entrances closed.
LMW is just not an orator or a public speaker. Vivian was a national level debater back then. You do not need to be a Toastmaster to enter RI, or make it in GIC or equity banking.
Many of us talk smack about others, let's be honest. But one should know when to do so.
My time there was a third one they hire SJI to operate it
No, he is a pretty decent FM, to be frank. I would have more confidence in him than any of the 4G.
Or the perp might have a higher calibre weapon or more.
Signing entails a loss of policy flexibility. Betting the US wants to retain the choice rather than be constrained. A self imposed moratorium is different from a treaty accession.
That we could merely use sharp elbows was pretty good already. Tuas 2018 is a vital learning lesson.
The smart ACSian keeps such talk for kopi with the boys. Not in Parliament. He done mucked up .
This older traditionalist says it should be gone. Many others like myself think it is no one's business but the individuals.
Typical AC vs RI banter, but keep it out of Parliament thanks
We co-sponsored a UN resolution too. http The co-sponsoring list is there.
Yeah it is true, AC has always been the one with more posh backgrounds compared to RI.
Yeah, like how we did chores when we were young. Good way to bring them up.
You asked the question once. Now you are just a troll.
They're putting everyone thru pain just to get at the boomers. If inconvenience is the aim, why not just stop boomers from going out? Put age in the safe entry, and deny them. Stop holding us all hostage what the fuck
You speak of subreddit of Singapore as though as it is one entity with a single mind when in fact it is made up of many anonymous individuals of varied backgrounds who log on to reddit to kill some time.
death per age-group broken down into vax status e.g. 3% of vaxxed but not boosted 80+ died when infected with covid
I hate you for pointing this out. Now I cannot unsee it /
Ang moh and Chinese are ok. See, so much diversity.
Can 4D chess this one? Maybe the best way to repeal it is to file a bunch of police reports.
I got a long story about gambling debt and whatnot. The dude looks like he is in his 40s. Saw a 30s looking tissue seller before.
I sleep a lot more in university and now as a working adult, I actually have a proper sleep schedule.
Pretty scary situation. One points towards the street. Two point toward each other.
Sorry for being curious. How did that even work out with the mother's family?
brilliant! All the best and cannot wait to try it out!
Not really. covid spreads via aerosol. So those gels probably have limited effectiveness with regards to covid specifically
When you have an irresponsible Government that imports people during a pandemic like theres no tommorrow, ordinary and responsible Singaporeans suffer.
Construction workers are hired by construction companies and subcontractors for property developers, not by the Government. What mechanisms do you propose to diversify the supply chain?
God is everywhere, but I need to go to a particular place at a particular to worship him? shaking my head
At least the police officer is alive and unharmed to handle the paperwork
He spent two decades overseas, I think he has got the western influence style
I had this exact training scenario when I was an fulltime national serviceman. When an aggressor lunges you with a knife, shoot.
This isn't a fight between town councils of who gets the best upgrades. Please do not turn it into one. it is a fight of who gets a seat in parliament to fight on behalf of Singaporeans.
Worse is that they are freaking Singaporean PRs. Imagine the pettiness of some people attacking him
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues. clown face clown face clown face
As much as I hate to disagree. I do not think it will ever be repealed.
Green milk means the cow was dead for at least a week
Maybe in 10 years they will start enforcing it again and you are screwed.
Was expecting like 10 warning shots to the chest. Guess I've been watching too much PoliceActivity.
feel like that is a subset of watchers, most of the people i know still like the series, i guess it is fair because the anime is pretty high quality but I do not know knowing how it ends kills it for me
unpopular opinion AOT ending is dogshit and is just a scuffed code geass, isayama wrote himself into a corner that he did not know how to get out of, the ending isn't really as deep as everyone thinks
'How do you even chao keng an antigen rapid test result?' Is this guy serious?
Hypodermic needle into edge of tin foil. Turn video resolution down. Darken room.
no. But can put vinegar in the buffer reagent bottle
Obviously you do your shenanigans before starting the video. What your boss going to do? Send you a couriered antigen rapid test test and ask you to break the seal on the video?
So can you climb walls and shoot webs from your wrists now?
So does China have a right to its territorial integrity in places like Taiwan?
The dark dangerous forests of Yishun, where pursuing enemies will not follow
We view pro business and pro worker as a zero sum game. that is sad
Where did this quote come from? I vaguely remember it.
all over this thread got people just basically blaming OP for not being thick skinned enough . so blatant
Why are you so intent on defending him? If you do not like a practise, and you know the practise is important to someone's culture/identity, keep it to yourself. Insulting it would 100% be not right.
There's so many beautiful things in the world to see and experience your focusing on the bad stuff also you can leave Singapore and go somewhere else
Did you guys listen to the translator when the Russians spoke? o m g. She speaks so fast, like the guys in the bidding war programes.
The innocence and simplicity of these people makes them appreciate every small thing out there. I cannot find the right word to describe this, but i think this video is very touching.
Everybody's struggle. You have similar issues with christian/buddhist/hindu advocates etc
Very sad news to hear such a young life taken. Rest in Peace.
The Malay-Muslim culture is pretty much the end result of that combination if you ask me.
I do not think that was ever a crime according to Singapore law
dude please take care and reach out for assistance if you need any counselling. my god. i cannot imagine.
heartbroken. my deepest condolences. and to the students needing counselling please reach out.
I felt it in the west. It was really subtle, I thought it was the MRT construction nearby
